{"abs":"A response spectrum method for stationary random vibration analysis of linear, multi-degree-of-freedom systems is developed. The method is based on the assumption that the input excitation is a wide-band, stationary Gaussian process and the response is stationary. However, it can also be used as a good approximation for the response to a transient stationary Gaussian input with a duration several times longer than the fundamental period of the system. Various response quantities, including the mean-squares of the response and its time derivative, the response mean frequency, and the cumulative distribution and the mean and variance of the peak response are obtained in terms of the ordinates of the mean response spectrum of the input excitation and the modal properties of the system. The formulation includes the cross-correlation between modal responses, which is shown to be significant for modes with closely spaced natural frequencies. The proposed procedure is demonstrated for an example structure that is subjected to an ensemble of earthquake-induced base excitations. Computed results based on the response spectrum method are in close agreement with simulation results obtained from time-history dynamic analysis. The significance of closely spaced modes and the error associated with a conventional method that neglects the modal correlations are also demonstrated.","title":"A response spectrum method for random vibration analysis for MDOF Systems","id":229644827,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229644827_A_response_spectrum_method_for_random_vibration_analysis_for_MDOF_Systems","names":["Armen Der Kiureghian","Earthquake Engineering \u0026 Structural Dynamics"],"references":{"245544146":"Note on the Distribution of the Largest Value of a Random Function with Applications to Gust Loading","240196433":"Properties of Spectral Moments with Applications to Random Vibration","229784883":"Stochastic consideration in seismic analysis of structures","247403323":"Response Spectra of Earthquake Ground Motion","28784977":"Simulated Earthquake Motions","252833081":"On the Distribution of the First-Passage Time for Normal Stationary Random Processes","258875766":"Dynamics Of Structures","229578759":"A Replacement for The SRSS Method in Seismic Analysis","247258992":"Probabilistic Theory of Structural Dynamics"},"citedIn":{"251551226":"Cholesterol as a Modulator of the HIV1 gp41 Fusion Domain\u0027s Function","245077139":"Earthquake response spectrum analysis of offshore platforms","230419123":"Accidental torsion in buildings due to base rotation excitation","227831197":"Stochastic analysis of structures and piping systems subjected to stationary multiple support excitations","251503090":"Shock spectrum analysis method for dynamic demand of bridge structures subjected to barge collisions","227578500":"Generalization of floor spectra including oscillator-structure interaction","245343883":"An improved probabilistic spectrum superposition","283665404":"Determination of Seismic Response of Structures Using Ellipsoid Envelope","233292016":"Dimensionnement d\u0027une section en béton armé soumise à une enveloppe elliptique de sollicitations dynamiques combinées","275183486":"Seismic Performance of Conventional Girder Bridges in Moderate Seismic Regions","227870351":"Stochastic response of foundations","229631665":"Calibration of Structural Models Using Fuzzy Mathematics","242130253":"Concurrent Design Forces in Structures under Three-Component Orthotropic Seismic Excitation","281640172":"Generate floor response spectra Part 1.
