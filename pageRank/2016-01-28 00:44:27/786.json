{"abs":"The increasing complexity and difficulty of system administration has been long recognized. Studies indicate that because of the difficulty and complexity, the cost of administering systems is ten times the cost of the actual hardware. Here, we present ABSA; ABSA is an agent-based solution to automated system administration. ABSA architecture is introduced to minimize the cost of administering computers in multi platform networks and to provide a simple, consistent, expandable and integrated system administration tool. ABSA system supports important system administration features such as domainwise administration, automated error handling and default system configuration besides others.","title":"System Administration Using Software Agents.","id":220166672,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220166672_System_Administration_Using_Software_Agents","names":["Shahram Rahimi","Santhosh Ramakrishna","Informatica"],"references":{},"citedIn":{"242438241":"2002. - \"A Modeling Tool for Intelligent-Agen t Based Systems: Api-Calculus","242447431":"\"Design of High Performance Distributed Snapshot/Recover y Algorithms","242286565":"EDITORIAL BOARDS, PUBLISHING COUNCIL"},"index":786}
