{"abs":"We introduce a new sampling algorithm, the equi-energy sampler, for efficient statistical sampling and estimation. Complementary to the widely used temperature-domain methods, the equi-energy sampler, utilizing the temperature--energy duality, targets the energy directly. The focus on the energy function not only facilitates efficient sampling, but also provides a powerful means for statistical estimation, for example, the calculation of the density of states and microcanonical averages in statistical mechanics. The equi-energy sampler is applied to a variety of problems, including exponential regression in statistics, motif sampling in computational biology and protein folding in biophysics.","title":"Equi-energy sampler with applications in statistical inference and statistical mechanics","id":2120858,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2120858_Equi-energy_sampler_with_applications_in_statistical_inference_and_statistical_mechanics","names":["Supeng Kou","Qing Zhou","Wing Hung Wong","The Annals of Statistics"],"references":{"242503284":"The Calculation of Posterior Distributions by Data Augmentation: Rejoinder","1866589":"Exchange Monte Carlo Method and Application to Spin Glass Simulations","224910629":"Sampling-Based Approaches to Calculate Marginal Densities","200105001":"Equation of State by Fast Computing Machines","221669680":"Stochastic Relaxation, Gibbs Distributions,and the Bayesian Restoration of Images","20237426":"Identifying protein-binding sites from unaligned DNA fragments","20982984":"Sequence Logos: A New Way to Display Consensus Sequences","265369049":"Slice sampling.
