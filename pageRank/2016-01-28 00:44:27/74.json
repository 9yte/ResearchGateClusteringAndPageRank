{"abs":"advantages of a Bayesian approach. Whilst of course we recognize the importance and intellectual standing of the long debate about philosophies of inference at a more fundamental level, nevertheless it is surely true that some of the main historical objections to Bayesian inference have included the difficulty of computation, the need to approximate, the necessity to use stylized priors, and the inability to assess the impact of arbitrary assumptions in prior specifications. MCMC answers these objections amazingly well, and indeed also allows one to perturb the likelihood function. For those of us who were closet Bayesians, or at least are open-minded enough to discover what the paradigm can provide, MCMC does remove reasons not to be Bayesian. Geyer\u0027s claim that similar progress has been made in likelihood inference is surely grossly overstated. Integration is central to the Bayesian paradigm but runs into problems for almost any moderately complicated","title":"[Bayesian Computation and Stochastic Systems]: Rejoinder","id":243103678,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243103678_Bayesian_Computation_and_Stochastic_Systems_Rejoinder","names":["Julian Besag","Peter Green","David Higdon","Kerrie Mengersen","Statistical Science"],"references":{"265465075":"Tweedie, R.L.: Rates of convergence of the Hastings and Metropolis algorithms.
