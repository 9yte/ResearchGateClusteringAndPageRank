{"abs":"The optimal thinning and rotation age policy for a stand subject to risk of destruction by windthrow is investigated. In particular, risk is not assumed exogenous as in previous research, but is modelled as endogenous to stand management. It is shown that the optimal solution when risk is endogenous differs significantly from the optimal solution to a problem where risk is assumed absent or exogenous. We find that in spite of substantial fixed costs related to thinning, the optimal number of thinnings increases and the optimal intensity of each thinning decreases. Furthermore, we find that the shortening effect of risk on the optimal rotation age is reduced substantially, when the thinning strategy is optimized subject to the effect on the risk levels. We conclude that the presence of endogenous risk strongly affects the optimal management strategy, and that an ecologically better founded approach to stand management is optimal in such cases. A group of solutions centred around a local optimum was characterized by fewer, more intense thinnings and a drastic shortening of the rotation age. If fixed costs were to increase substantially, this local optimum may become global, but still result in a longer rotation and more frequent thinnings than in the case of exogenous risk. Finally, features of the model\u0027s risk dynamics allow an analysis of the effect of changing the stand\u0027s resistance to and ability to recover from (i.e. the stand\u0027s resilience) the disturbances caused by thinnings, measured as changes in the susceptibility to windthrow. We find that in spite of the fixed costs related to thinning, a decrease in resistance or resilience makes it optimal to increase the number of thinnings, while at the same time making each thinning less intense.","title":"Optimal stand management with endogenous risk of sudden destruction","id":223881139,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223881139_Optimal_stand_management_with_endogenous_risk_of_sudden_destruction","names":["Bo Jellesmark Thorsen","Finn Helles","Forest Ecology and Management"],"references":{"233658569":"The Effect of Potential Catastrophic Mortality and Other Unpredictable Events on Optimal Forest Rotation Policy","233310669":"Windthrow Probability as a Function of Stand Characteristics and Shelter","222482436":"Consumption/Pollution Tradeoffs in an Environment Vulnerable to Pollution-Related Catastrophic Collapse","249532568":"Optimal harvest scheduling at the forest level in the presence of the risk of fire","222751343":"The Efeects of the Risk of Fire on the Optimal Rotation of a Forest","233591296":"A Multistage Stochastic Programming Model for Sustainable Forest-Level Timber Supply Under Risk of Fire","233550918":"A Nonlinear Programming Approach to Stand Optimization","222459443":"On the application of stability concepts in ecology.
