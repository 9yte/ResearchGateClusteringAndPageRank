{"abs":"Many real-world problems involve two types of problem difficulty: i) multiple, conflicting objectives and ii) a highly complex search space. On the one hand, instead of a single optimal solution competing goals give rise to a set of compromise solutions, generally denoted as Pareto-optimal. In the absence of preference information, none of the corresponding trade-offs can be said to be better than the others. On the other hand, the search space can be too large and too complex to be solved by exact methods. Thus, efficient optimization strategies are required that are able to deal with both difficulties. Evolutionary algorithms possess several characteristics that are desirable for this kind of problem and make them preferable to classical optimization methods. In fact, various evolutionary approaches to multiobjective optimization have been proposed since 1985, capable of searching for multiple Paretooptimal solutions concurrently in a single simulation run. However, in spite of this...","title":"Evolutionary Algorithms for Multiobjective Optimization: Methods and Applications","id":2575571,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2575571_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Multiobjective_Optimization_Methods_and_Applications","names":["Eckart Zitzler","Multiobjective Optimization","Eidgenssischetechnische Hochschule Zrich"],"references":{"2754984":"Finding Multimodal Solutions Using Restricted Tournament Selection","220201252":"System-Level Synthesis Using Evolutionary Algorithms","2243366":"Optimized Software Synthesis for DSP Using Randomization Techniques (Revised Version of TIK Report 32)","2629039":"Approximating the Nondominated Front Using the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy","232653783":"Minimizing memory requirements for chain-structured synchronous dataflow programs","220885536":"Use of Genetic Algorithms in Multicriteria Optimization to Solve Industrial Problems.","3642940":"An interactive fuzzy satisficing method for multiobjective multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problems through genetic algorithms","220885542":"The Neighborhood Constraint Method: A Genetic Algorithm-Based Multiobjective Optimization Technique.","34058890":"Theory of evolutionary algorithms and application to system synthesis /","2241068":"Evolutionary Algorithm Based Exploration of Software Schedules for Digital Signal Processors","2802724":"Searching for Diverse, Cooperative Populations with Genetic Algorithms","228057735":"Computers and Intractability: A Guide to NP-Completeness","224839796":"Using Genetic Algorithms to Solve a Multi-Objective Ground-Water Monitoring Problem","3755949":"On a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm and Its Convergence to the Pareto Set","2997817":"Synchronous data flow.
