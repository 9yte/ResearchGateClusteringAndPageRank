{"abs":"This paper analyses the recently suggested particle approach to filtering time series. We suggest that the algorithm is not robust to outliers for two reasons: the design of the simulators and the use of the discrete support to represent the sequentially updating prior distribution. Both problems are tackled in this paper. We believe we have largely solved the first problem and have reduced the order of magnitude of the second. In addition we introduce the idea of stratification into the particle filter which allows us to perform on-line Bayesian calculations about the parameters which index the models and maximum likelihood estimation. The new methods are illustrated by using a stochastic volatility model and a time series model of angles. Some key words: Filtering, Markov chain Monte Carlo, Particle filter, Simulation, SIR, State space. 1 1","title":"“Filtering Via Simulation: Auxiliary Particle Filter”","id":2369650,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2369650_Filtering_Via_Simulation_Auxiliary_Particle_Filter","names":["Michael Pitt","Neil Shephard","Journal of the American Statistical Association"],"references":{"242503284":"The Calculation of Posterior Distributions by Data Augmentation: Rejoinder","2699816":"Stochastic Volatility: Likelihood Inference And Comparison With Arch Models","261593363":"Stochastic Simulation","3361206":"Novel Approach to Nonlinear/Non-Gaussian Bayesian State Estimation","243767425":"Visual tracking by stochastic propagation of conditional density","4896064":"Volatility and Links Between National Stock Markets","2430895":"Metropolized Independent Sampling with Comparisons to Rejection Sampling and Importance Sampling","2796321":"Dynamic Conditional Independence Models And Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods","229761469":"Diagnostic check of non-standard time series","229447357":"Simulation‐based estimation of models with lagged latent variables","2752314":"On Sequential Simulation-Based Methods for Bayesian Filtering","4815069":"‘A New Approach To the Analysis of Time Series and the Business Cycle’","271512891":"Monte Carlo Filter and Smoother for Non-Gaussian Nonlinear State Space Models","223433031":"Recursive Bayesian Estimation Using Gaussian Sums","239665887":"Non-Gaussian State—Space Modeling of Nonstationary Time Series","45257636":"Arch models","4895197":"Large Sample Properties Generalized Method of Moments Estimators","235926677":"Bayesian Forecasting and Dynamic Linear Models","245581880":"Bayesian Inference and Prediction for Mean and Variance Shifts in Autoregressive Time Series","5140050":"The Dynamics of Exchange Rate Volatility: A Multivariate Latent Factor ARCH model","30996602":"On Gibbs Sampling for State Space Models","38367467":"Remarks on a multivariate transformation.
