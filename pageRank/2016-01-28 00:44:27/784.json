To achieve the calibration to market data, we introduce into the quan- titative finance literature a robust and ecient optimisation tool â€” the cross entropy method.","title":"DEFAULT CORRELATION MODELLING: BINOMIAL LATTICES, CROSS ENTROPY AND PERFECT MATCH","id":255586615,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255586615_DEFAULT_CORRELATION_MODELLING_BINOMIAL_LATTICES_CROSS_ENTROPY_AND_PERFECT_MATCH","names":["TAO PENG"],"references":{"23697049":"Factor Distributions Implied by Quoted CDO Spreads","228940071":"Cross-Entropy Method","247906613":"Dynamic Models of Portfolio Credit Risk: A Simplified Approach","228262287":"On Default Correlation: A Copula Function Approach","228338008":"A comparative analysis of CDO pricing models","228707639":"Dynamic credit correlation modeling"},"citedIn":{},"index":784}
