{"abs":"A general framework for using Monte Carlo methods in dynamic systems is provided and its wide applications indicated. Under this framework, several currently available techniques are studied and generalized to accommodate more complex features. All of these methods are partial combinations of three ingredients: importance sampling and resampling, rejection sampling, and Markov chain iterations. We deliver a guideline on how they should be used and under what circumstance each method is most suitable. Through the analysis of differences and connections, we consolidate these methods into a generic algorithm by combining desirable features. In addition, we propose a general use of Rao-Blackwellization to improve performances. Examples from econometrics and engineering are presented to demonstrate the importance of Rao-Blackwellization and to compare different Monte Carlo procedures.
