{"abs":"This paper compares possibilities of Visual .NET C# with other compiled programming environments (e.g. Microsoft Visual C++, Borland C++ Builder) and interpreted languages like for example HyperFun. The study focuses on the aspects of developing a system for direct interpretation of objects described by implicit functions. The starting point of the comparison is based on a HyperFun system. The results show the speed-up reached by compiling implicitly defined objects and illustrate possibilities of tested languages to create similar structures.","title":"The Implicit Function Modeling System - Comparison of C++ and C# Solutions","id":247903884,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247903884_The_Implicit_Function_Modeling_System_-_Comparison_of_C_and_C_Solutions","names":["Uhlir Karel","Vaclav Skala"],"references":{"247203532":"POLYGONIZATION BY THE EDGE SPINNING","220067662":"Function representation in geometric modeling: concepts, implementation and applications.
