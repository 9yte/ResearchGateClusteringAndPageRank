{"abs":"This paper investigates the problem of assembly line balancing problem, in which the products in the production line may undergo to be reworked on the current task. Since the real manufacturing systems deal with the stochastic nature of the items in production lines, this paper considers the simple assembly line balancing problem type 2 (SALBP-II) under the conditions of stochastic processing time of tasks and the element of reworking system. Exposing to the stochastic conditions encouraged us to handle the problem via simulation optimization procedure, which uses the well known genetic algorithm as an optimization tool. Results show the adaptation and effectiveness of GA to considered problem.","title":"A simulation optimization approach to un-paced assembly line balancing problem-II with additional reworking issue","id":261169822,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261169822_A_simulation_optimization_approach_to_un-paced_assembly_line_balancing_problem-II_with_additional_reworking_issue","names":[],"references":{"245387010":"Scheduling and balancing assembly lines with the task deterioration effect","257403645":"A Simulated Annealing Technique for Multi-Objective Simulation Optimization","245310868":"Line balancing and model sequencing to reduce work overload in mixed-model U-line production environments","220470991":"Scheduling of parallel machines to minimize total completion time subject to s-precedence constraints","234125560":"Discret-Event System Simulation","222684136":"A multi-objective genetic algorithm for robust flight scheduling using simulation.
