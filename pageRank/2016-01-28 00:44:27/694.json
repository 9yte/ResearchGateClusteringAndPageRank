{"abs":"Currently, an alternative framework using the hypervolume indicator to guide the search for elite solutions of a multi-objective problem is studied in the evolutionary multi-objective optimization community very actively, comparing to the traditional Pareto dominance based approach. In this paper, we present a dynamic neighborhood multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on hypervolume indicator (DNMOEA/HI), which benefits from both Pareto dominance and hypervolume indicator based frameworks. DNMOEA/HI is featured by the employment of hypervolume indicator as a truncation operator to prune the exceeded population, while a well-designed density estimator (i.e., tree neighborhood density) is combined with the Pareto strength value to perform fitness assignment. Moreover, a novel algorithm is proposed to directly evaluate the hypervolume contribution of a single individual. The performance of DNMOEA/HI is verified on a comprehensive benchmark suite, in comparison with six other multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm. Solutions obtained by DNMOEA/HI well approach the Pareto optimal front and are evenly distributed over the front, simultaneously.","title":"Achieving balance between proximity and diversity in multi-objective evolutionary algorithm","id":220310732,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220310732_Achieving_balance_between_proximity_and_diversity_in_multi-objective_evolutionary_algorithm","names":["Ke Li","Sam Kwong","Jingjing Cao","Miqing Li","Jinhua Zheng","Ruimin Shen","Information Sciences"],"references":{"3418802":"Dynamic Multiobjective Optimization Problems: Test Cases, Approximations, and Applications","2629039":"Approximating the Nondominated Front Using the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy","220265511":"Improving NSGA-II Algorithm Based on Minimum Spanning Tree","3419059":"AbYSS: Adapting Scatter Search to Multiobjective Optimization","28358328":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","3418687":"A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II.
