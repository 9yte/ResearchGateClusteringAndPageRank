{"abs":"In the first part of this paper various methods to calculate failure probabilities of structural components or systems are critically reviewed in light of their accuracy and (computational) efficiency. In this context it is shown, that, particularly for problems of higher dimensions, approximation techniques utilizing linearization may be prone to considerable errors. The second part of the work contains an alternative method to calculate failure probabilities which combines the advantages of both the importance sampling technique (accuracy and the possibility of error estimation) and the design point calculation (identification of the region where highest failure probability is to be expected).","title":"A critical appraisal of methods to determine failure probabilities.
