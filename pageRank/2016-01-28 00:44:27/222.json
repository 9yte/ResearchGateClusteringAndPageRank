{"abs":"Models for which the likelihood function can be evaluated only up to a parameter-dependent unknown normalising constant, such as Markov random field models, are used widely in computer science, statistical physics, spatial statistics, and network analysis. However, Bayesian analysis of these models using standard Monte Carlo methods is not possible due to the intractability of their likelihood functions. Several methods that permit exact, or close to exact, simulation from the posterior distribution have recently been developed. However, estimating the evidence and Bayes\u0027 factors (BFs) for these models remains challenging in general. This paper describes new random weight importance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo methods for estimating BFs that use simulation to circumvent the evaluation of the intractable likelihood, and compares them to existing methods. In some cases we observe an advantage in the use of biased weight estimates. An initial investigation into the theoretical and empirical properties of this class of methods is presented. Some support for the use of biased estimates is presented, but we advocate caution in the use of such estimates.","title":"Bayesian model comparison with un-normalised likelihoods","id":291353622,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291353622_Bayesian_model_comparison_with_un-normalised_likelihoods","names":["Richard G Everitt","Adam Michael Johansen","Ellen Rowing","Melina Evdemon-Hogan","Statistics and Computing"],"references":{"27468515":"An efficient MCMC method for distributions with intractable normalising constants","258817325":"Towards Automatic Model Comparison: An Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo Approach","257673689":"ABC methods for model choice in Gibbs random fields","239524417":"Playing Russian Roulette with Intractable Likelihoods","290889759":"Sequential Monte Carlo without likelihoods","2123628":"Estimating Ratios of Normalizing Constants Using Linked Importance Sampling","222419087":"Friel, N.: Bayesian inference for exponential random graph models.
