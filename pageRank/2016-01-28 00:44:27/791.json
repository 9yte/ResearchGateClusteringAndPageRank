{"abs":"Do you want easy access to the latest methods in scientific computing? This greatly expanded third edition of Numerical Recipes has it, with wider coverage than ever before, many new, expanded and updated sections, and two completely new chapters. The executable C++ code, now printed in color for easy reading, adopts an object-oriented style particularly suited to scientific applications. Co-authored by four leading scientists from academia and industry, Numerical Recipes starts with basic mathematics and computer science and proceeds to complete, working routines. The whole book is presented in the informal, easy-to-read style that made earlier editions so popular. Highlights of the new material include: a new chapter on classification and inference, Gaussian mixture models, HMMs, hierarchical clustering, and SVMs; a new chapter on computational geometry, covering KD trees, quad- and octrees, Delaunay triangulation, and algorithms for lines, polygons, triangles, and spheres; interior point methods for linear programming; MCMC; an expanded treatment of ODEs with completely new routines; and many new statistical distributions.","title":"In Numerical Receipts in C: The Art of Scientific Computing","id":215755923,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215755923_In_Numerical_Receipts_in_C_The_Art_of_Scientific_Computing","names":["William Press","Brian Flannery","Saul Teukolsky","William Vetterling"],"references":{"225828439":"Monte Carlo Methods","248820474":"VEGAS â€“ An Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Integration Program"},"citedIn":{},"index":791}
