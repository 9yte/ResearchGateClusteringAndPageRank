{"abs":"ying at least the rough asymptotics of a rare event probability, often described by a large deviations result. This type of analysis can be formidable in complex models, so the domain of importance sampling, while substantial, does not include all problems of interest. This work deals with an alternative method for rare event simulation that uses the technique of splitting # Also a#liated to IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598 sample paths. The main advantage of this technique is that it appears to require rather little model structure for its applicability. Splitting for rare event simulation was originally discussed by #6# in the context of estimating rare particle transmission probabilities in physics. Since then, there were only a few intermittent references to the use of this technique for rare event simulation ##2#, #1#, #5##. However, recently it was revisited in a signi#cantwayby#9#, #8#, and #10# for estimating probabilities of r","title":"Multilevel Splitting for Estimating Rare Event Probabilities","id":2469281,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2469281_Multilevel_Splitting_for_Estimating_Rare_Event_Probabilities","names":["Paul Glasserman","Philip Heidelberger","Perwez Shahabuddin","Tim Zajic","Operations Research"],"references":{"225210701":"Fast simulation of rare events in queueing and reliability models","242328432":"RESTART: A method for accelerating rare event simulations","256594602":"Importance sampling in systems simulation: a practical failure?","247333211":"Rare event simulation: a modified RESTART-method using the LRE-algorithm","245186455":"Optimizing cell importances using an extension of the DSA — theory, implementation, preliminary results","242386046":"Estimation of Particle Transmission by Random Sampling","220136433":"Analysis of an importance sampling estimator for tandem queues ACM TOMACS 4, 22-42","239666535":"Enhancement of the Accelerated Simulation Method RESTART by Considering Multiple Thresholds","236463254":"Application of the direct statistical approach on a multisurface splitting problem in Monte Carlo calculations","234793578":"CSIM: a C-based process-oriented simulation language","3619855":"Rare event simulation in stochastic models","242504973":"Markov Chains with Stationary Probabilities","3772320":"RESTART: A straightforward method of fast simulation of rare event","2355513":"The Asymptotic Efficiency of Simulation Estimators.
