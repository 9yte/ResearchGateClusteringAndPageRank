{"abs":"There are several studies on the desirable properties that a compari- son method for evolutionary multiobjective algorithms must have. One of these properties is called compatibility and completeness. There is a theo- rem that states that, in the general case (inflnite size sets), it is not pos- sible to create a unary comparison method with the property mentioned before. As a consequence, unary performance measures are considered to be less reliable than binary performance measures. In this paper we provide a further analysis for practical conditions (flnite size sets). We prove, for these conditions, that the impossibility to create a compatible and complete unary comparison method, is no longer valid. Our result opens the door for future research to establish whether or not is possible to create such a comparison method.","title":"On the possibility to create a compatible--complete unary comparison method for evolutionary multiobjective algorithms.","id":220741031,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220741031_On_the_possibility_to_create_a_compatible--complete_unary_comparison_method_for_evolutionary_multiobjective_algorithms","names":["Giovanni Lizárraga Lizárraga","Arturo Hernandez-Aguirre","Salvador Botello Rionda"],"references":{"216300934":"On metrics for comparing non-dominated sets","216300449":"Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving Multi-Objective Problems Second Edition","3418737":"Performance Assessment of Multiobjective Optimizers: An Analysis and Review","2642725":"Evaluating the Quality of Approximations to the Non-Dominated Set","216457304":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","27300447":"Set Theory and Logic"},"citedIn":{},"index":813}
