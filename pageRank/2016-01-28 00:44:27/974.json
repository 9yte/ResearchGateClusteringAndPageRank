{"abs":"Consider an irreducible random walk {Z n} on a locally finite graphG with infinitely many ends, and assume that its transition probabilities are invariant under a closed group Γ of automorphisms ofG which acts transitively on the vertex set. We study the limiting behaviour of {Z n} on the spaceΩ of ends ofG. With the exception of a degenerate case,Ω always constitutes a boundary of Γ in the sense of Furstenberg, and {Z n} converges a.s. to a random end. In this case, the Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions is solvable with respect toΩ. The degenerate case may arise when Γ is amenable; it then fixes a unique end, and it may happen that {Z n} converges to this end. If {Z n} is symmetric and has finite range, this may be excluded. A decomposition theorem forΩ, which may also be of some purely graph-theoretical interest, is derived and applied to show thatΩ can be identified with the Poisson boundary, if the random walk has finite range. Under this assumption, the ends with finite diameter constitute a dense subset in the minimal Martin boundary. These results are then applied to random walks on discrete groups with infinitely many ends.","title":"Boundaries of random walks on graphs and groups with infinitely many ends","id":225400430,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225400430_Boundaries_of_random_walks_on_graphs_and_groups_with_infinitely_many_ends","names":["Wolfgang Woess","Israel Journal of Mathematics"],"references":{"248559324":"Group Theory and Three-Dimensional Manifolds","243768714":"Connectivity in infinite graphs","246959158":"Noncommuting Random Products","268550415":"Marches aléatoires sur les groupes de Lie","226909449":"Über unendliche Wege in Graphen","220442156":"Cutting up graphs","242443041":"Non-Negative Matrices and Markov Chains","245695671":"Combinatorial Group Theory Springer","38361627":"Random Walks on Discrete Groups: Boundary and Entropy","226535571":"Marche al�atoire sur le groupe libre et fronti�re de Martin","265986498":"Convergence to Ends for Random Walks on the Automorphism Group of a Tree","242968674":"Automorphisms and Endomorphisms of Infinite Locally Finite Graphs","225514282":"Amenability, unimodularity, and the spectral radius of random walks on infinite graphs","259362454":"Harmonic functions and ends of graphs","288969181":"An entropy criterion for maximality of the boundary of random walks on discrete groups","226194141":"Amenable group actions on infinite graphs","247330074":"Random walk on groups with a nite number of generators","226581928":"Positive harmonic functions and hyperbolicity","248390500":"Martin Boundaries of Random Walks: Ends of Trees and Groups","266515657":"The existence of 1- and 2-dimensional subspaces of a compact metric space","227040291":"A description of the Martin boundary for nearest neighbour random walks on free products","44478088":"Non-negative matrices and markov chains / E.
