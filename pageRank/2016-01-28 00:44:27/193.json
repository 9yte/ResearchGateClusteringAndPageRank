{"abs":"The problem of deriving approximations for multinormal integrals is examined using results of asymptotic analysis. The boundary of the integration domain given by g(x) \u003d 0 is simplified by replacing g(x) by its Taylor expansion at the points on the boundary with minimal distance to the origin. Two approximations which are obtained by using a linear or quadratic Taylor expansion are compared. It is shown that, applying a quadratic Taylor expansion, an asymptotic approximation for multinormal integrals can be obtained, whereas using linear approximations large relative errors may occur.","title":"Asymptotic Approximations for Multinormal Integrals","id":275188793,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275188793_Asymptotic_Approximations_for_Multinormal_Integrals","names":[],"references":{},"citedIn":{"273895762":"A fast and robust method for estimating the failure probability of structures","238493492":"Integration of Reliability And Possibility-Based Design Optimizations Using Performance Measure Approach","271224878":"First and second order approximate reliability analysis methods using evidence theory","270175263":"Reliability analysis and design of cantilever RC retaining walls against sliding failure","257451870":"A hybrid reliability model for structures with truncated probability distributions","245292953":"Optimal Engineering Design Method that Combines Safety Factors and Failure Probabilities: Application to Rubble-Mound Breakwaters","229501866":"Design of a composite beam using the failure probability‐safety factor method","283669473":"Confidence Bounds on Failure Probability Using MHDMR","283966182":"Asymptotic sampling - a tool for efficient reliability computation in high dimensions","283351529":"Lower-bound estimates of capacity in geotechnical reliability assessments","225686137":"An inverse-measure-based unilevel architecture for reliability-based design optimization","226293616":"Stochastic finite element analysis of the free vibration of laminated composite plates","257335129":"An adaptive dimension decomposition and reselection method for reliability analysis","222289965":"On Computation Methods for Structural Reliability Analysis","286504192":"Structural Reliability Based on Genetic Algorithm-Monte Carlo (GAMC)","256968258":"Asymptotic Sampling for reliability analysis of adhesive bonded stepped lap composite joints","284115706":"Integration of Multinormal Densities on Surfaces","285236758":"Enriched Performance Measure Approach (PMA+) for Reliability-Based Design Optimization","281639135":"Development of a Nanosatellite De-Orbiting System by Reliability Based Design Optimization","283470333":"Advances in System Reliability Analysis Under Uncertainty","224815999":"High-dimensional model representation for structural reliability analysis","271783722":"Uncertainty Quantification and Stochastic Modeling with Matlab®","222687839":"Probabilistic fracture mechanics: J-estimation and finite element methods","281183965":"Coupled finite element and probalistic transformation method","280626330":"A Safety Concept for Penetration Analyses of Suction Caissons in Sand","260126114":"Sampling-based approach for design optimization in the presence of interval variables","257006965":"A new efficient simulation method to approximate the probability of failure and most probable point","245078962":"Uncertainty analyses in fault trees and Bayesian networks using FORM/SORM methods","240409213":"Reliability of composites in a random stress state","263380638":"A non-probabilistic structural reliability analysis method based on a multidimensional parallelepiped convex model","265316605":"Uncertainty Modelling in Systems Reliability Analysis","223178850":"Probabilistic elastic-plastic fracture analysis of circumferentially cracked pipes with finite-length surface flaws","225380191":"Sequential optimization and reliability assessment for multidisciplinary systems design","224815958":"Enhanced high-dimensional model representation for reliability analysis","264031372":"Akaike Information Criterion-Based Reliability Analysis for Discrete Bimodal Information","257270372":"Reliability analysis of roof wedges and rockbolt forces in tunnels","288073754":"A reliability index extrapolation method for separable limit states","229573533":"Effects of structural uncertainties on TMD design: A reliability‐based approach","228589716":"Reliability of Uncertain Dynamical Systems with Multiple Design Points","225633098":"Component and system reliability-based topology optimization using a single-loop method.
