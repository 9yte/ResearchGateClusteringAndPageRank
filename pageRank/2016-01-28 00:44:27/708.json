{"abs":"This paper reports simulation experiments, applying the cross entropy method such as the importance sampling algorithm for efficient estimation of rare event probabilities in Markovian reliability systems. The method is compared to various failure biasing schemes that have been proved to give estimators with bounded relative errors. The results from the experiments indicate a considerable improvement of the performance of the importance sampling estimators, where performance is mea- sured by the relative error of the estimate, by the relative error of the estimator, and by the gain of the importance sampling simulation to the normal simulation.","title":"Importance Sampling Simulations of Markovian Reliability Systems Using Cross-Entropy","id":4785522,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4785522_Importance_Sampling_Simulations_of_Markovian_Reliability_Systems_Using_Cross-Entropy","names":["Ad Ridder","Annals of Operations Research"],"references":{"224103803":"Modeling and analysis of computer system availability","37616893":"Application of the Cross-Entropy Method to the Buffer Allocation Problem in a Simulation-Based Environment","227447407":"Fast Simulation of Markov Chains with Small Transition Probabilities","225210701":"Fast simulation of rare events in queueing and reliability models","225656913":"Probabilistic modeling of computer system availability","227446636":"Importance Sampling for the Simulation of Highly Reliable Markovian Systems","2837897":"Rare Event Estimation for Static Models via Cross-Entropy and Importance Sampling","3885977":"Adaptive importance sampling simulation of queueing networks","222461568":"Optimization of computer simulation models with rare events.
