{"abs":"â–º An enhanced DE variant (MODEA) is proposed for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). â–º It is a fusion of opposition based learning, random localization and a single population DE structure. â–º MODEA introduces a new selection mechanism for generating a well distributed Pareto optimal front. â–º The efficiency of MODEA is validated on a set of 9 bi-objective and 5 tri-objective problems. â–º Modifications/enhancements embedded in DE provides an efficient mechanism for solving MOPs.","title":"An efficient Differential Evolution based algorithm for solving multi-objective optimization problems.","id":220288943,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220288943_An_efficient_Differential_Evolution_based_algorithm_for_solving_multi-objective_optimization_problems","names":["Musrrat Ali","Patrick Siarry","Millie Pant"],"references":{"4242497":"Opposition-Based Learning: A New Scheme for Machine Intelligence","221228524":"DEMO: Differential Evolution for Multiobjective Optimization","220176795":"Multi-objective self-adaptive differential evolution with elitist archive and crowding entropy-based diversity measure.
