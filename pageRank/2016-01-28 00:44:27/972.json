{"abs":"To approximate the Pareto front, most existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms store the non-dominated solutions found so far in the population or in an external archive during the search. Such algorithms often require a high degree of diversity of the stored solutions and only a limited number of solutions can be achieved. By contrast, model-based algorithms can alleviate the requirement on solution diversity and in principle, as many solutions as needed can be generated. This paper proposes a new model-based method for representing and searching non-dominated solutions. The main idea is to construct Gaussian process based inverse models that map all found non-dominated solutions from the objective space to the decision space. These inverse models are then used to create offspring by sampling the objective space. To facilitate inverse modeling, the multivariate inverse function is decomposed into a group of univariate functions, where the number of inverse models is reduced using a random grouping technique. Extensive empirical simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits robust search performance on a variety of medium to high dimensional multiobjective optimization test problems. Additional non-dominated solutions are generated a posteriori using the constructed models to increase the density of solutions in the preferred regions at a low computational cost.","title":"A Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Using Gaussian Process-Based Inverse Modeling","id":270960934,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270960934_A_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Using_Gaussian_Process-Based_Inverse_Modeling","names":["Ran Cheng","Yaochu Jin","Kaname Narukawa","Bernhard Sendhoff","IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation"],"references":{"3949503":"Scalable multi-objective optimization test problems","220380974":"Multiobjective optimization problems with complicated Pareto sets, MOEA/D and NSGA-II","3421242":"A Multi-objective Genetic Local Search Algorithm and Its Application to Flowshop Scheduling","221228449":"MOPED: A Multi-objective Parzen-Based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm for Continuous Problems","242367203":"Flexible and efficient Gaussian process models for machine learning","256442073":"Hyper-heuristics: A survey of the state of the art","226116715":"Multi-Objective Optimization","261189763":"A Gaussian Process Surrogate Model Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm for Medium Scale Expensive Optimization Problems","220499767":"Dimension Reduction by Local Principal Component Analysis","221008825":"Improving hypervolume-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms by using objective reduction methods","12473894":"Comparison of Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms: Empirical Results","261165962":"A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition and probability model","224211267":"Decomposition-Based Memetic Algorithm for Multiobjective Capacitated Arc Routing Problem","2240388":"Thiele, L.: Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms: A Comparative Case Study and the Strength Pareto Approach.
