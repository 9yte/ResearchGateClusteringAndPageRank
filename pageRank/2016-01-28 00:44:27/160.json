{"abs":"We introduce a novel time-homogeneous Markov embedding of a class of time inhomogeneous Markov chains widely used in the context of Monte Carlo sampling algorithms which allows us to answer one of the most basic, yet hard, question about the practical implementation of these techniques. We also show that this embedding sheds some light on the recent result of [#maire-douc-olsson2013]. We discuss further applications of the technique.","title":"A note on one of the Markov chain Monte Carlo novice\u0027s questions","id":275055334,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275055334_A_note_on_one_of_the_Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo_novice\u0027s_questions","names":["Christophe Andrieu"],"references":{"225989992":"Nonlocal Monte Carlo algorithm for self-avoiding walks with fixed endpoints","38363017":"Eigenvalue Bounds on Convergence to Stationarity for Nonreversible Markov Chains, with an Application to the Exclusion Process","2101298":"Superdiffusivity of Asymmetric Exclusion Process in Dimensions One and Two","227611763":"Updating Schemes, Correlation Structure, Blocking, and Parametization for the Gibbs Sampler","2269174":"A Note on Metropolis-Hastings Kernels for General State Spaces","31403274":"Monte Carlo Sampling Methods Using Markov Chains and Their Application","31081996":"Optimum Monte-Carlo Sampling Using Markov Chains","231609430":"Convergence properties of pseudo-marginal Markov chain Monte Carlo\nalgorithms","2655031":"Information bounds for Gibbs samplers"},"citedIn":{"286510152":"Surprising Convergence Properties of Some Simple Gibbs Samplers under Various Scans"},"index":160}
