{"abs":"We present novel sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms for the simulation of two broad classes of rare events which,are suitable for the estimation of tail probabilities and probability density functions in the regions of rare events, as well as the simulation of rare system trajectories. These methods have some,connection with previously proposed importance sampling (IS) and interacting particle system (IPS) methodologies, particularly those of [8, 4], but differ significantly from previous approaches,in a number,of respects: especially in that they operate directly on the path space of the Markov process of interest.","title":"Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers for Rare Events","id":200707517,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200707517_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_Samplers_for_Rare_Events","names":["Adam Michael Johansen","Pierre Del Moral","Arnaud Doucet"],"references":{"2469281":"Multilevel Splitting for Estimating Rare Event Probabilities","265681840":"Sequential Imputations and Bayesian Missing Data Problems","2255780":"The Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method: An Approach To Approximate Counting And Integration","3290965":"Importance sampling for polarization-mode dispersion","2923975":"An Improved Particle Filter for Non-linear Problems","2834503":"Trans-Dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo","245199761":"Adaptive Multilevel Splitting for Rare Event Analysis","38326887":"Simulating Normalizing Constants: From Importance Sampling to Bridge Sampling to Path Sampling","2670104":"Reversible Jum Markov Chain Monte Carlo Computation and Bayesian Model Determination","248115483":"Topics in Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers","2126101":"Genealogical particle analysis of rare events","3786543":"A comparison of RESTART implementations","38322352":"Rare Events Simulation for Heavy-Tailed Distributions","1825409":"Sequential monte carlo samplers","233990793":"Feynman-Kac Formulae: Genealogical and Interacting Particle Systems With Applications"},"citedIn":{"225331054":"Uncertainty quantification in a chemical system using error estimate-based mesh adaption","221304753":"A Static SMC Sampler on Shapes for the Automated Segmentation of Aortic Calcifications","257665561":"Bayesian Parameter Inference for Partially Observed Stopped Processes","1771736":"On sequential Monte Carlo, partial rejection control and approximate Bayesian computation","46515713":"SMCTC: Sequential Monte Carlo in C++","261058377":"Bayesian model comparison via path-sampling sequential Monte Carlo","46510925":"Particle methods for the estimation of credit portfolio loss distributions","51917204":"Sequential Monte Carlo EM for multivariate probit models","237816418":"Distributed Control and Stochastic Analysis of Hybrid Systems Supporting Safety Critical Real-Time Systems Design","221525242":"Path-sampling for state-dependent importance sampling","29601804":"Particle methods: An introduction with applications","267010418":"On the Foundations and the Applications of Evolutionary Computing","2998263":"An Overview of Existing Methods and Recent Advances in Sequential Monte Carlo","251572324":"Bayesian Model Comparison for Compartmental Models with Applications in Positron Emission Tomography","224747646":"Radial basis function regression using trans-dimensional sequential Monte Carlo","220412152":"Accurate Uncertainty Quantification Using Inaccurate Computational Models","264800788":"Improved Diffusion Monte Carlo","220207039":"A multi-resolution, non-parametric, Bayesian framework for identification of spatially-varying model parameters","221401168":"Automatic Segmentation of Vertebrae from Radiographs: A Sample-Driven Active Shape Model Approach","254405900":"A Survey of Sequential Monte Carlo Methods for Economics and Finance","29617444":"A non asymptotic variance theorem for unnormalized Feynman-Kac particle models","228665417":"A nonasymptotic theorem for unnormalized Feynmanâ€“Kac particle models","220206985":"An efficient surrogate-based method for computing rare failure probability","226031060":"Sequential Monte Carlo for rare event estimation","220286671":"On population-based simulation for static inference","283350545":"A GENERAL ANALYTICAL SOLUTION FOR THE OCCURRENCE PROBABILITY OF A SEQUENCE OF ORDERED EVENTS FOLLOWING A POISON STOCHASTIC PROCESS","276211339":"Unbiasedness of some generalized Adaptive Multilevel Splitting algorithms","267258963":"Some Non-Standard Sequential Monte Carlo Methods and Their Applications","233815890":"Split Sampling: Expectations, Normalisation and Rare Events","220286431":"Efficient Monte Carlo simulation via the generalized splitting method","4993330":"Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers"},"index":26}
