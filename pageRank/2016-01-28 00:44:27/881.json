{"abs":"Recent evolutions of computer-aided product development and massive integration of numerical simulations to the design process require new methodologies to manage the continuously increasing flow of data and decrease the computational costs of numerical design of experiments. This paper presents a literature review of Simulation Data Management strategy and adaptive design of experiments methodology to detect possible links between these two fields and identify potential improvements for simulation process shortening. Adaptive design of experiments is based on several methods implying a profusion of different technics. Re-using best practices may help designers to choose relevant methods to reduce computational cost and simulation process duration","title":"Simulation data management for adaptive design of EXPERIMENTS: a litterature review","id":277567471,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277567471_Simulation_data_management_for_adaptive_design_of_EXPERIMENTS_a_litterature_review","names":["Gaëtan Blondet","Julien Le Duigou","Nassim Boudaoud","Benoit Eynard","Mechanics and Industry"],"references":{"239393484":"A review on design, modeling and applications of computer experiments.
