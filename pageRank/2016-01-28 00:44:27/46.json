{"abs":"We present a non asymptotic theorem for interacting particle approximations of unnormalized Feynman-Kac models. We provide an original stochastic analysis based on Feynman-Kac semigroup techniques combined with recently developed coalescent tree-based functional representations of particle block distributions. We present some regularity conditions under which the $\\LL_2$-relative error of these weighted particle measures grows linearly with respect to the time horizon yielding what seems to be the first results of this type for this class of unnormalized models. We also illustrate these results in the context of particle simulation of static Boltzmann-Gibbs measures and restricted distributions, with a special interest in rare event analysis.","title":"A non asymptotic variance theorem for unnormalized Feynman-Kac particle models","id":29617444,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/29617444_A_non_asymptotic_variance_theorem_for_unnormalized_Feynman-Kac_particle_models","names":["Frédéric Cérou","Pierre Del Moral","Arnaud Guyader"],"references":{"226058616":"Rare-Event Simulation","2129637":"Coalescent tree based functional representations for some Feynman-Kac particle models","200707517":"Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers for Rare Events","222297395":"Splitting for rare event simulation: A large deviation approach to design and analysis","245199761":"Adaptive Multilevel Splitting for Rare Event Analysis","231743804":"Rare event simulation","200744518":"Sequential Monte-Carlo Methods in Practice","29649681":"Asymptotic Robustness of Estimators in Rare-Event Simulation","29596955":"Genetic Genealogical Models in Rare Event Analysis","1871781":"Equilibrium free-energy differences from nonequilibrium measurements: A master-equation approach","1825409":"Sequential monte carlo samplers","233990793":"Feynman-Kac Formulae: Genealogical and Interacting Particle Systems With Applications","1848003":"Equilibrium Sampling From Nonequilibrium Dynamics"},"citedIn":{"268689539":"Butterfly resampling: asymptotics for particle filters with constrained interactions","48174175":"Particle Approximation of the Intensity Measures of a Spatial Branching Point Process Arising in Multitarget Tracking","227522317":"Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo . . .","257665561":"Bayesian Parameter Inference for Partially Observed Stopped Processes","268391801":"A Sharp First Order Analysis of Feynman-Kac Particle Models","265127940":"Fluctuation Analysis of Adaptive Multilevel Splitting","29601545":"Rare event simulation for a static distribution","228665450":"Parameter inference for stopped processes","29601804":"Particle methods: An introduction with applications","41953425":"Particle approximations of a class of branching distribution flows arising in multi-target tracking","45919917":"Sequential Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing","23566004":"Bayesian inference based only on simulated likelihood: Particle filter analysis of dynamic economic models","258062774":"Computational Methods for a Class of Network Models","255796968":"Snell Envelope with Small Probability Criteria","267010418":"On the Foundations and the Applications of Evolutionary Computing","225348983":"Simulation and Estimation of Extreme Quantiles and Extreme Probabilities","242331345":"On the Convergence of Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo Methods","225074890":"Non-asymptotic Error Bounds for Sequential MCMC Methods in Multimodal\nSettings","48174205":"Forward Smoothing using Sequential Monte Carlo","269417068":"A Stable Particle Filter in High-Dimensions","273067556":"Biased Online Parameter Inference for State-Space Models","29597157":"A Backward Particle Interpretation of Feynman-Kac Formulae","223466681":"Non-asymptotic Error Bounds for Sequential MCMC and Stability of\nFeynman-Kac Propagators","266541321":"Stochastic models and methods.
