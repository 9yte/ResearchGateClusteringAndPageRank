{"abs":"Splitting and importance sampling are the two primary techniques to make important rare events happen more frequently in a simulation, and obtain an unbiased estimator with much smaller variance than the standard Monte Carlo estimator. Importance sampling has been discussed and studied in several articles presented at the winter simulation conference in the past. A smaller number of WSC articles have examined splitting. In this paper, we review the splitting technique and discuss some of its strengths and limitations from the practical viewpoint. We also introduce improvements in the implementation of the multilevel splitting technique. This is done in a setting where we want to estimate the probability of reaching B before reaching (or returning to) A when starting from a fixed state x notin B where A and B are two disjoint subsets of the state space and B is very rarely attained. This problem has several practical applications","title":"Splitting for Rare-Event Simulation","id":224061436,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224061436_Splitting_for_Rare-Event_Simulation","names":["Pierre L’Ecuyer","Valerie Demers","Bruno Tuffin"],"references":{"26388496":"Human Information Behavior","235802762":"A Comparison of the Information Seeking Patterns of Researchers in the Physical and Social Sciences","2469281":"Multilevel Splitting for Estimating Rare Event Probabilities","245346455":"An Introduction to Stochastic Modeling","247823567":"The EXXON Valdez: An Assessment of Crisis Prevention and Management Systems","242386046":"Estimation of Particle Transmission by Random Sampling","236404763":"Confidence interval procedures for Monte Carlo transport simulations","227446046":"Importance Sampling for Stochastic Simulations","236366720":"Automatic importance estimation in forward Monte Carlo calculations","3786543":"A comparison of RESTART implementations","3772320":"RESTART: A straightforward method of fast simulation of rare event","220136450":"Rare events, splitting, and quasi-Monte Carlo","246879016":"MTTF estimation by Mo nte Carlo methods using Markov models","4819432":"Decisions Under Time Pressure: How Time Constraint Affects Risky Decision Making","225210701":"Fast simulation of rare events in queueing and reliability models","225828439":"Monte Carlo Methods","222439015":"An Equilibrium Characterization of The Term Structure","220535189":"A Relational View of Information Seeking and Learning in Social Networks","41035459":"The splitting method in rare event simulation","229101074":"Information Foraging","227447346":"Variance Reduction via Lattice Rules","242377911":"Strategies for Quasi-Monte Carlo","3023205":"A large deviations perspective on the efficiency of multilevel splitting","220658930":"Analysis of RESTART simulation: Theoretical basis and sensitivity study","266304907":"Design and analysis of simulation experiments.
