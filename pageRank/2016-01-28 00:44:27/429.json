{"abs":"We consider linear systems with unspecified parameters that lie between given upper and lower bounds. Except for a few special cases, the computation of many quantities of interest for such systems can be performed only through an exhaustive search in parameter space. We present a general branch and bound algorithm that implements this search in a systematic manner and apply it to computing the minimum stability degree.","title":"Branch and bound algorithm for computing the minimum stability degree of parameter-dependent linear systems.
