{"abs":"This paper reviews the literature on Bayesian experimental design. A unified view of this topic is presented, based on a decision-theoretic approach. This framework casts criteria from the Bayesian literature of design as part of a single coherent approach. The decision-theoretic structure incorporates both linear and nonlinear design problems and it suggests possible new directions to the experimental design problem, motivated by the use of new utility functions. We show that, in some special cases of linear design problems, Bayesian solutions change in a sensible way when the prior distribution and the utility function are modified to allow for the specific structure of the experiment. The decision-theoretic approach also gives a mathematical justification for selecting the appropriate optimality criterion.","title":"Bayesian Experimental Design: A Review","id":38363031,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38363031_Bayesian_Experimental_Design_A_Review","names":["Kathryn Chaloner","Isabella Verdinelli","Statistical Science"],"references":{"38359624":"Optimal Designs for Comparing Test Treatments with a Control Utilizing Prior Information","221956664":"Bayesian design for accelerated life testing","30975451":"Optimal Regression Design for Control in Linear Regression","239043132":"Results in the Theory and Construction of D-optimum Experimental Designs","266514406":"Design of experiments for parameter estimation in multiresponse situations","3027239":"Optimal input signals for parameter estimation in dynamic systems-survey and new results.
