{"abs":"A general method, suitable for fast computing machines, for investigating such properties as equations of state for substances consisting of interacting individual molecules is described. The method consists of a modified Monte Carlo integration over configuration space. Results for the two-dimensional rigid-sphere system have been obtained on the Los Alamos MANIAC and are presented here. These results are compared to the free volume equation of state and to a four-term virial coefficient expansion.","title":"Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines","id":200622065,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200622065_Equation_of_State_Calculations_by_Fast_Computing_Machines","names":["Metropolis NS","AW Rosenbluth","M.
