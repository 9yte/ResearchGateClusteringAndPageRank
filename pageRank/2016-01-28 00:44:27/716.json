{"abs":"This paper aims to provide a state-of-the-art review of the transport network design problem (NDP) under uncertainty and to present some new developments on a bi-objective-reliable NDP (BORNDP) model that explicitly optimizes the capacity reliability and travel time reliability under demand uncertainty. Both are useful performance measures that can describe the supply-side reliability and demand-side reliability of a road network. A simulation-based multi-objective genetic algorithm solution procedure, which consists of a traffic assignment algorithm, a genetic algorithm, a Pareto filter, and a Monte-Carlo simulation, is developed to solve the proposed BORNDP model. A numerical example based on the capacity enhancement problem is presented to demonstrate the tradeoff between capacity reliability and travel time reliability in the NDP.","title":"Transport Network Design Problem under Uncertainty: A Review and New Developments","id":233057431,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233057431_Transport_Network_Design_Problem_under_Uncertainty_A_Review_and_New_Developments","names":["Anthony Chen","Zhong Zhou","Piya Chootinan","Seungkyu Ryu","Chao Yang","Shuai Wang","Transport Reviews"],"references":{"245327263":"Special Issue on Improving Network Reliability Through ITS Technologies","4037374":"A simulation-based mult-objective genetic algorithm (SMOGA) for transportation network design problem","245563303":"Robust Pricing of Transportation Networks Under Uncertain Demand","245560554":"Mean-Variance Model for the Build-Operate-Transfer Scheme Under Demand Uncertainty","23527471":"On the reserve capacity of priority junctions and roundabouts","32181735":"Evaluation and enhancement of transport network reliability: Network equilibrium based approach","229530787":"Capacity related reliability for transportation networks","238665076":"Reliable System Optimal Network Design: A Convex Mean-Variance Type Model with Implicit Chance Constraints","223599388":"Models and Algorithm for Stochastic Network Designs","245560051":"Travel Time Reliability with Risk-Sensitive Travelers","245560119":"Optimal Improvement Scheme for Network Reliability","229651237":"Special issue: Network reliability and transport modelling","228702134":"Robust Dynamic Continuous Network Design Problem","235782613":"Stochastic Transportation Network Design Problem with Spatial Equity Constraint","239438366":"Effect of Route Choice Models on Estimating Network Capacity Reliability","248987340":"Models and algorithms for road network design: a review and some new developments.
