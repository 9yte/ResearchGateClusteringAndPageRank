{"abs":"Metropolis algorithms for approximate sampling of probability measures on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces are considered and a generalization of the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) proposal is introduced. The new proposal is able to incorporate information of the measure of interest. A numerical simulation of a Bayesian inverse problem indicates that a Metropolis algorithm with such a proposal performs independent of the state space dimension and the variance of the observational noise. Moreover, a qualitative convergence result is provided by a comparison argument for spectral gaps. In particular, it is shown that the generalization inherits geometric ergodicity from the Metropolis algorithm with pCN proposal.","title":"On a generalization of the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Metropolis algorithm","id":275055333,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275055333_On_a_generalization_of_the_preconditioned_Crank-Nicolson_Metropolis_algorithm","names":["Daniel Rudolf","Bj√∂rn Sprungk"],"references":{"239546247":"MCMC methods for diffusion bridges","51931128":"Explicit error bounds for Markov chain Monte Carlo","38357609":"Markov Chains for Exploring Posterior Distributions","221661751":"MCMC Methods for Functions: Modifying Old Algorithms to Make Them Faster","268227549":"Dimension-independent likelihood-informed MCMC","230872806":"Linear Operators, Part I: General Theory","264623874":"Algorithms for Kullback-Leibler Approximation of Probability Measures in Infinite Dimensions","233937081":"Positivity of hit-and-run and related algorithms","243052917":"On Majorization, Factorization, and Range Inclusion of Operators on Hilbert Space","245481576":"Inverse problems: A Bayesian perspective","38329826":"Central limit theorem for additive functionals of reversible Markov processes and applications to simple exclusion, Commun.
