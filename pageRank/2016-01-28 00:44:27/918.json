{"abs":"We test globally corrected hybrid updating algorithms for various lattice theories: a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators, pure SU(3) theory, and QCD with four flavors of dynamical staggered quarks. Systematic errors, acceptance, and time correlations are studied as functions of discretization step size, momentum refreshing frequency, volume, coupling and fermion-matrix-inversion residue.","title":"Tests of globally corrected hybrid updating","id":13330565,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13330565_Tests_of_globally_corrected_hybrid_updating","names":["H Gausterer","S Sanielevici","Physical review D: Particles and fields"],"references":{"13330569":"Tuning the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm","222018937":"Hybrid Monte Carlo","13331273":"Testing an exact algorithm for simulation of fermionic QCD","258091296":"Finite-Temperature Phase Transitions in SU(3) Lattice Gauge Theory with Dynamical, Light Fermions","13333352":"Langevin simulation of lattice field theories.
