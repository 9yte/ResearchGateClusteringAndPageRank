{"abs":"This short note presents a method for efficiently updating ordinary kriging estimates and variances when one or more additional samples are incorporated into the kriging system. First, the foundation linear algebra result is presented. Then the update equations are derived. Finally, an illustrative application of updating is briefly discussed.","title":"Efficient Updating of Kriging Estimates and Variances","id":238354904,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238354904_Efficient_Updating_of_Kriging_Estimates_and_Variances","names":["R.
