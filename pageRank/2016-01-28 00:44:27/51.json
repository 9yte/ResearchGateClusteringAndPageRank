{"abs":"In this paper we describe a method for improving genetic-algorithm-based optimization using search control. The idea is to utilize the sequence of points explored during a search to guide further exploration. The proposed method is particularly suitable for continuous spaces with expensive evaluation functions, such as arise in engineering design. Empirical results in several engineering design domains demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the e#ciency and reliability of the GA optimizer. Keywords: genetic algorithms, design optimization, machine learning To appear in Artificial Intelligence in Engineering, Design, Analysis and Manufacturing 1 Introduction Genetic Algorithms (GAs) [ Goldberg 1989 ] are search algorithms that simulate the process of natural selection. GAs attempt to find a good solution to some problem (e.g., finding the maximum of a function) by randomly generating a collection (\"population \") of potential solutions (\"individuals\") to t...","title":"Learning to be Selective in Genetic-Algorithm-Based Design Optimization","id":2349484,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2349484_Learning_to_be_Selective_in_Genetic-Algorithm-Based_Design_Optimization","names":["Khaled Rasheed","Haym Hirsh","Artificial intelligence for engineering design analysis and manufacturing"],"references":{"2485857":"Genetic Algorithms for Real Parameter Optimization","221603472":"PROLEARN: Towards a Prolog Interpreter that Learns.","220343557":"Chunking in Soar: The Anatomy of a General Learning Mechanism","2598475":"Working from Blueprints: Evolutionary Learning for Design","221345340":"An Advanced Evolution Should Not Repeat its Past Errors.","242388861":"Learning Search Control Knowledge: An Explanation-based Approach","201976281":"Using Genetic Algorithms in Engineering Design Optimization with Non-Linear Constraints","2336982":"High Performance Supersonic Missile Inlet Design Using Automated Optimization","30873058":"Genetic + Data Structures \u003d Evolution Programs","222501755":"A genetic algorithm for continuous design space search","2261304":"Gado: A Genetic Algorithm For Continuous Design Optimization","223938660":"Using Modeling Knowledge to Guide Design Space Search","30870312":"Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization and Machine Learning.
