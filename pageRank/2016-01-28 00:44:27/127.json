{"abs":"I present an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for principal component analysis (PCA). The algorithm allows a few eigenvectors and eigenvalues to be extracted from large collections of high dimensional data. It is computationally very efficient in space and time. It also naturally accommodates missing information. I also introduce a new variant of PCA called sensible principal component analysis (SPCA) which defines a proper density model in the data space. Learning for SPCA is also done with an EM algorithm. I report results on synthetic and real data showing that these EM algorithms correctly and efficiently find the leading eigenvectors of the covariance of datasets in a few iterations using up to hundreds of thousands of datapoints in thousands of dimensions.","title":"Em algorithms for pca and spca","id":2491114,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2491114_Em_algorithms_for_pca_and_spca","names":["Sam Roweis","Advances in neural information processing systems"],"references":{"242630710":"Turbulence and the Dynamics of Coherent Structures: I, II and III","224881862":"Mixtures of Probabilistic Principal Component Analysers","221995817":"Maximum Likelihood from Incomplete Data Via EM Algorithm","4771963":"Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis","2811474":"ARPACK Users\u0027 Guide: Solution of Large-scale Eigenvalue Problems by Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Methods","13338034":"Mixtures of Probabilistic Principal Component Analyzers","44473500":"The algebraic eigenvalue problem / James H.
