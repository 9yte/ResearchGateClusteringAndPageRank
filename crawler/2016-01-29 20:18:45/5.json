{"abs":"This paper deals with the problem of estimating the volume of the excursion set of a function f:ℝd →ℝ above a given threshold, under a probability measure on ℝd that is assumed to be known. In the industrial world, this corresponds to the problem of estimating a probability of failure of a system. When only an expensive-to-simulate model of the system is available, the budget for simulations is usually severely limited and therefore classical Monte Carlo methods ought to be avoided. One of the main contributions of this article is to derive SUR (stepwise uncertainty reduction) strategies from a Bayesian formulation of the problem of estimating a probability of failure. These sequential strategies use a Gaussian process model of f and aim at performing evaluations of f as efficiently as possible to infer the value of the probability of failure. We compare these strategies to other strategies also based on a Gaussian process model for estimating a probability of failure.","title":"Sequential design of computer experiments for the estimation of aprobability of failure","id":46587486,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46587486_Sequential_design_of_computer_experiments_for_the_estimation_of_aprobability_of_failure","names":["Julien Bect","David Ginsbourger","Ling Li","Victor Picheny","Emmanuel Vazquez","Statistics and Computing"],"references":{"228940071":"Cross-Entropy Method","4772045":"Bayesian Calibration of Computer Models","4772685":"Estimating percentiles of uncertain computer code outputs","222934337":"An examination of methods for approximating implicit limit state functions from the viewpoint of statistical learning theory","227615641":"Probabilistic sensitivity analysis of complex models: A Bayesian approach","44709664":"Évaluation d\u0027un risque d\u0027inondation fluviale par planification séquentielle d\u0027expériences","271513121":"The Cross-Entropy Method","222289965":"On Computation Methods for Structural Reliability Analysis","38363487":"The Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments","265574083":"Design and analysis of computer experiments.
