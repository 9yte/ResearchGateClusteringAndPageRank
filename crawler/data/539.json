{"abs":"For the past decade or so, evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) methodologies have earned wide popularity for solving complex practical optimization problems, simply due to their ability to find a representative set of Pareto-optimal solutions for mostly two, three, and some extent to four and five-objective optimization problems. Recently, emphasis has been made in addressing the decision-making activities in arriving at a single preferred solution. The multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) literature offers a number of possibilities for such a task involving user preferences which can be supplied in different forms. This paper presents an interactive methodology for finding a preferred set of solutions, instead of the complete Pareto-optimal frontier, by incorporating preference information of the decision maker. Particularly, we borrow the concept of light beam search and combine it with the NSGA-II procedure. The working of this procedure has been demonstrated on a set of test problems and on engineering design problems having two to ten objectives, where the obtained solutions are found to match with the true Pareto-optimal solutions. The results highlight the utility of this approach towards eventually facilitating a better and more reliable optimization-cum-decision-making task.","title":"Light beam search based multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms","id":224301744,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224301744_Light_beam_search_based_multi-objective_optimization_using_evolutionary_algorithms","names":["Kalyan Deb","Abhay Kumar"],"references":{"220741544":"Reference Point Based Multi-Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms","265581939":"The Light Beam Search Over a Non-dominated Surface of a Multiple-objective Programming Problem","257196732":"The ‘Light Beam Search’ approach – an overview of methodology applications","220741729":"Interactive evolutionary multi-objective optimization and decision-making using reference direction method","3418687":"A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II.
