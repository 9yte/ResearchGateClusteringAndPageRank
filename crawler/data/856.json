{"abs":"This paper presents a taxonomy of existing approaches for using response surfaces for global optimization. Each method is illustrated with a simple numerical example that brings out its advantages and disadvantages. The central theme is that methods that seem quite reasonable often have non-obvious failure modes. Understanding these failure modes is essential for the development of practical algorithms that fulfill the intuitive promise of the response surface approach. Key words: global optimization, response surface, kriging, splines 1.","title":"A Taxonomy of Global Optimization Methods Based on Response Surfaces","id":216300861,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216300861_A_Taxonomy_of_Global_Optimization_Methods_Based_on_Response_Surfaces","names":["Donald R.
