{"abs":"In evaluating structural reliability under stochastic loadings, the system parameters such as stiffness, damping, strength, excitation frequency content and duration, etc., are usually assumed given. In reality, however, these quantities are seldom perfectly known. Their uncertainties may play a major role as far as the overall structural reliability is concerned. This paper reviews currently available methods to include this parameter uncertainties and a new method is also proposed. The accuracy and analytical and numerical efforts required are compared. Through numerical examples on systems under dynamic excitation, collapse of ductile or brittle redundant systems, the advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated.","title":"On fast integration for time variant structural reliabiity","id":222790897,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222790897_On_fast_integration_for_time_variant_structural_reliabiity","names":["Y.K.
