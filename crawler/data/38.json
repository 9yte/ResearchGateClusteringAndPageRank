{"abs":"Computer simulation is often used to study complex physical and engineering processes. While a computer simulator can often be viewed as an inexpensive way to gain insight into a system, it can still be computationally costly. Much of the recent work on the design and anal-ysis of computer experiments has focused on scenarios where the goal is to fit a response surface or process optimization. In this article, we develop sequential methodology for estimating a contour from a complex computer code. The approach uses a stochastic process model as a surrogate for the computer simulator. The surrogate model and associated uncertainty are key components in a new criterion used to identify the computer trials aimed specifically at improv-ing the contour estimate. The proposed approach is applied to exploration of a contour for a network queuing system. Issues related to practical implementation of the proposed approach are also addressed.","title":"Sequential Experiment Design for Contour Estimation From Complex Computer Codes","id":228365548,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228365548_Sequential_Experiment_Design_for_Contour_Estimation_From_Complex_Computer_Codes","names":["Pritam Ranjan","Derek R.
