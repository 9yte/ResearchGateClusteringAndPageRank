{"abs":"This article deals with estimations of probabilities of rare events using fast simulation based on the splitting method. In this technique, the sample paths are split into multiple copies at various stages in the simulation. Our aim is to optimize the algorithm and to obtain a precise confidence interval of the estimator using branching processes. The numerical results presented suggest that the method is reasonably efficient.","title":"Rare event simulation","id":231743804,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231743804_Rare_event_simulation","names":["Agnès Lagnoux","Probability in the Engineering and Informational Sciences"],"references":{"38339977":"On Monte Carlo estimation of large deviations probabilities","242328432":"RESTART: A method for accelerating rare event simulations","228057634":"Poisson Approximations via the Poisson Clumping Heuristic","2255780":"The Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method: An Approach To Approximate Counting And Integration","29596955":"Genetic Genealogical Models in Rare Event Analysis","252344245":"Three Examples of Monte-Carlo Markov Chains: At the Interface Between Statistical Computing, Computer Science, and Statistical Mechanics"},"citedIn":{"270470108":"Evaluation of the Reliability of Repairable (s–t) Networks by Fast Simulation Method","224576295":"Estimating the probability fo false alarm for a zero-bit watermarking technique","277606156":"Fast Simulation of Reliability of Repairable System Operating in Two Modes","267001824":"Reliability of Safety-Critical Systems: Theory and Applications","228665450":"Parameter inference for stopped processes","245199761":"Adaptive Multilevel Splitting for Rare Event Analysis","222538703":"Effective branching splitting method under cost contraint","231079689":"An overview of importance splitting for rare event simulation","222666891":"Computing the first eigenelements of some linear operators using a branching Monte Carlo method","226410286":"Analysis and Improvements of Path-Based Methods for Monte Carlo Reliability Evaluation of Static Models","284900779":"An island particle algorithm for rare event analysis","50844690":"Quelques Techniques de Couplage entre Méthodes Numériques Déterministes et Méthodes de Monte-Carlo","266943935":"A survey of rare event simulation methods for static input-output models","220674608":"Influence of input PDF parameters of a model on a failure probability estimation","262256058":"Splitting for rare event simulation in biochemical systems","260563996":"Improvement of satellite conflict prediction reliability through use of the adaptive splitting technique","243104929":"A Two-Step branching splitting model under cost constraint for rare event analysis","45340972":"Estimating the Minimal Length of Tardos Code","29617444":"A non asymptotic variance theorem for unnormalized Feynman-Kac particle models","256081252":"Missile target accuracy estimation with importance splitting","265416246":"Recommendations for the tuning of rare event probability estimators","228665417":"A nonasymptotic theorem for unnormalized Feynman–Kac particle models","226031060":"Sequential Monte Carlo for rare event estimation","228685390":"Sampling per Mode for Rare Event Simulation in Switching Diffusions","251300174":"Stochastic Enumeration Method for Counting NP-Hard Problems","271738439":"Evaluation of the Probability of Functional Failure of a Redundant System by Importance Sampling Method","220740240":"Levy walk evolution for global optimization.","271952461":"Fast Simulation of the Functional Failure of an s – t-Network with Repair","274495909":"Evaluation of the Hazard of Failure of the Redundant System by Fast Simulation Methods","29612735":"Statistical analysis of a dynamic model for dietary contaminant exposure","256080958":"Estimating separation distance loss probability between aircraft in uncontrolled airspace in simulation","220286431":"Efficient Monte Carlo simulation via the generalized splitting method","46103168":"Adaptive particle techniques and rare event estimation","281985457":"Review of risk assessment status for air traffic","256117819":"On Computer-Intensive Simulation and Estimation Methods for Rare Event Analysis in Epidemic Models"},"index":588}
