{"abs":"First/second-order reliability method (FORM/SORM) is considered to be one of the most reliable computational methods for structural reliability. Its accuracy is generally dependent on three parameters, i.e. the curvature radius at the design point, the number of random variables and the first-order reliability index. In the present paper, the ranges of the three parameters for which FORM/SORM is accurate enough are investigated. The results can help us to judge when FORM is accurate enough, when SORM is required and when an accurate method such as the inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT) method is required. A general procedure for FORM/SORM is proposed which includes three steps: i.e. point fitting limit state surface, computation of the sum of the principal curvatures Ks and failure probability computation according to the range of Ks. The procedure is demonstrated by several examples.","title":"A general procedure for first/second-order reliabilitymethod (FORM/SORM)","id":222305920,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222305920_A_general_procedure_for_firstsecond-order_reliabilitymethod_FORMSORM","names":["Yan-Gang Zhao","Tetsuro Ono","Structural Safety"],"references":{"245284895":"Efficient Algorithm for Second-Order Reliability Analysis","222857578":"Refined second-order reliability analysis","236660920":"Methods of Structural Safety","245301372":"Basic Analysis of Structural Safety","230663803":"Distributions in Statistics: Continuous Univariate Distribution-II","244955839":"A Fast Efficient Response Surface Approach for Structural Reliability Problems","265794417":"Method of Structural Safety","273800443":"Second‐Order Reliability Approximations","238874385":"Approximations to the Non-Central Chi-Square Distribution","223592988":"A new look at the response surface approach for reliability analysis","251807120":"New approximations for SORM: part I","268023403":"On the Non-Central Chi-Square Distribution","236660847":"Exact and Invariant Second Moment Code Format","245284587":"Improvement Of Second-Order Reliability Estimates by Importance Sampling","36275678":"The non-central chi-square distribution /","222776539":"First-order third-moment reliability method","245211489":"New Approximations for SORM integrals","245284675":"Distribution of Quadratic Forms in Normal Space—Application to Structural Reliability"},"citedIn":{"250329195":"The Fatigue Reliability Analysis of Stress Criterion in Multiaxial High Cycle Fatigue","257774300":"A new adaptive importance sampling Monte Carlo Method for structural reliability","245409569":"Risk assessment of revetments by Monte Carlo simulation","229728434":"The probabilistic key‐group method","263361975":"Reliability analysis of tested steel I-beams with web openings","11462824":"Use of the most likely failure point method for risk estimation and risk uncertainty analysis","257227996":"A risk decision model of the contract generation for hydropower generation companies in electricity markets","222540234":"A supply chain analysis framework for assessing state-level forest biomass utilization policies in the United States","281461071":"Modelling dependence structures of soil shear strength data with bivariate copulas and applications to geotechnical reliability analysis","229131426":"Hybrid probabilistic interval analysis of bar structures with uncertainty using a mixed perturbation Monte-Carlo method","271608250":"Dimensionality reduction and visualization of structural reliability problems using polar features","225480443":"A novel method to estimate derailment probability due to track geometric irregularities using reliability techniques and advanced simulation methods","267805434":"Bayesian fatigue damage and reliability analysis using Laplace approximation and inverse reliability method","242456446":"System Design of Undersea Vehicles with Multiple Sources of Uncertainty","251012347":"Stochastic and reliability analysis of a propeller with model reduction","222983493":"Reliability and Sensitivity Analysis of Transonic Flutter Using Improved Line Sampling Technique","251632237":"Intérêt du rFVIIa dans les chocs hémorragiques post-traumatiques.
