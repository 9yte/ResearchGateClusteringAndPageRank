{"abs":"In this paper a non-generational genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization problems is proposed. For each element in the population a domination count is defined together with a neighborhood density measure based on a sharing function. Those two measures are then non-linearly combined in order to define the individual \u0027s fitness. Numerical experiments with four testproblems taken from the evolutionary multi-objective literature are performed and the results are compared with those obtained by other evolutionary techniques. 1 Introduction A number of optimization problems (specially design problems) are actually multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) where the objectives are usually incommensurable and conflicting. As a result, there is usually not a single solution which optimizes all objectives simultaneously and a number of techniques have been developed in order to find a \"good\" solution to the MOP. The set of solutions which are such that no improvement can be made...","title":"A Non-generational Genetic Algorithm for Multiobjective Optimization","id":2243429,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2243429_A_Non-generational_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Multiobjective_Optimization","names":["Carlos Cristiano Hasenclever Borges","Helio Barbosa"],"references":{"220739625":"Construction of Test Problems for Multi-Objective Optimization.","2763393":"Multiobjective Optimization Using The Niche Pareto Genetic Algorithm","28352092":"Multi-objective Genetic Algorithms : Problem Difficulties and Construction of Test Problems","2465269":"An Overview of Evolutionary Algorithms in Multiobjective Optimization","220885593":"Genetic Algorithms for Multiobjective Optimization: FormulationDiscussion and Generalization.","216301392":"Multiple Objective Optimization with Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithms","2646461":"Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Research: A History and Analysis","12473894":"Comparison of Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms: Empirical Results","2333240":"Multiobjective Function Optimization Using Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms","236443691":"Some Experiments in Machine Learning Using Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithms","2464921":"The Nature of Niching: Genetic Algorithms and the Evolution of Optimal, Cooperative Populations","2791575":"A Comprehensive Survey of Evolutionary-Based Multiobjective Optimization Techniques","247932890":"The Nature of Niching: Genetic Algorithms and the Evolution of Optimal","243666680":"F1.9 Multicriterion decision making","225964648":"Lin, C.-Y.: Genetic search strategies in multicriterion optimal design.
