{"abs":"An algorithm for the calculation of structural reliability under combined loading is formulated. Loads or any other actions upon structures are modelled as independent random sequences. The relevant limit state criterion is pointwise approximated by a tangent hyperplane. The combination of time-variant actions then reduces to the calculation of the maximum of a sum of random variables which is facilitated through proper, discrete approximation of extreme value and other non-normal distribution functions by normal distributions. The iteration algorithm searches for an approximation point on the limit state criterion where the probability content of the failure domain limited by the tangent hyperplane reaches its maximum. Any type of continuous limit state criterion and any distribution type for the loads can be dealt with. The method is illustrated for a section of a wall without tensile strength loaded by a bending moment and a normal force.","title":"Structural Reliability Under Combined Random Load Sequences","id":256379905,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256379905_Structural_Reliability_Under_Combined_Random_Load_Sequences","names":["Rüdiger Rackwitz","Bernd Flessler","Computers \u0026 Structures"],"references":{},"citedIn":{"256968529":"A methodology for robust updating of nonlinear structural models","227063177":"Probabilistic Modelling of the Strength of Flat Compression Members","277919892":"Kriging response surface reliability analysis of a ship-stiffened plate with initial imperfections","271224878":"First and second order approximate reliability analysis methods using evidence theory","245294744":"Reliability Evaluation of Earth Slopes","257451870":"A hybrid reliability model for structures with truncated probability distributions","222350663":"General purpose procedure for reliability based structural optimization under parametric uncertainties","267763709":"A new method to solve the structural reliability index based on homotopy analysis","245288599":"Reliability Analysis of Open Drainage Channels under Multiple Failure Modes","236469777":"Response Surface Method Coupled with First-Order Reliability Method Based Methodology for Groundwater Flow and Contaminant Transport Model for the Uranium Tailings Pond Site","263085991":"Fatigue Reliability Assessment of an Offshore Supporting Structure","51720987":"GOAP: A Generalized Orientation-Dependent, All-Atom Statistical Potential for Protein Structure Prediction","250697441":"Convergence analysis of first order reliability method using chaos theory","258113403":"Effective structural sizing/shape optimisation through a reliability-related multifactor optimisation approach","228457863":"Practical first-order reliability computations using spreadsheet","257775430":"An efficient approach to reliability-based design optimization within the enhanced sequential optimization and reliability assessment framework","263085964":"Fatigue Reliability Assessment of Converted FPSO","239390311":"Resistance Factor for Wood in Bending or Tension","251592410":"Trimaximal mixing with predicted from a new type of constrained sequential dominance","248205038":"Random vibration and reliability of a damped thick rotating blade of generally orthotropic material","279736459":"Frequency Reliability-Based Robust Design of the Suspension Device of a Jarring Machine with Arbitrary Distribution Parameters","263085958":"Fatigue Reliability Assessment of Welded Joints of Very Fast Ferry Subjected to Combined Load","256919416":"Fuzzy structural analysis based on fundamental reliability concepts","222199058":"Uncertainty modeling in the fatigue reliability calculation of offshore structures","267659224":"Solutions of the First-Passage Problem by Importance Sampling","279384201":"Probabilistic Fracture Mechanics Handbook","242298463":"AGING AIRCRAFT FRETTING FATIGUE RELIABILITY ANALYSIS","222778728":"Reliability analysis by numerical integration and curve fitting","263085983":"Reliability Assessment of a Randomly Nonuniform Corroded Plate Subjected to Compressive Load","237190672":"Reliability analyses of activated sludge systems in attaining effluent standards","226473292":"A direct decoupling approach for efficient reliability-based design optimization","279384210":"First-Order and Second-Order Reliability Methods","257431406":"Advance first order second moment (AFOSM) method for single reservoir operation reliability analysis: A case study","273023102":"Stratified Response Surfaces for System Probabilistic Evaluation of Slopes","245294754":"Reliability Assessment of Basal-Heave Stability for Braced Excavations in Clay","233100760":"Reliability assessment of innovative designs in automotive industry","223188237":"Improved approximation for multinormal integral","257523481":"Reliability of short seismic links in shear","256421644":"Observations on structural system reliability and the role of modal correlations","239402498":"On Estimating the Reliability of Multiple Failure Region Problems Using Approximate Metamodels","228826596":"Enhanced Sequential Optimization and Reliability Assessment method for probabilistic optimization with varying design variance","245282519":"Methods and Object-Oriented Software for FE Reliability and Sensitivity Analysis with Application to a Bridge Structure","228593133":"Reliability Prediction of Tapered Composites Subjected to Fatigue Delamination","223270145":"Reliability analysis of automotive body-door subsystem","269062232":"Comparison of Non-Intrusive Polynomial Chaos and Stochastic Collocation Methods for Uncertainty Quantification","264710038":"Structural reliability analysis using a copula-function-based evidence theory model","223819010":"Reliability-based optimization in engineering using decomposition techniques and FORMS.
