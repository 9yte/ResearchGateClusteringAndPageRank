{"abs":"Gaussian random fields (GRFs) are important building blocks in hierarchical models for spatial data, but there is no practically useful, principled approach for selecting the prior on their hyperparameters. The prior is typically chosen in an \\emph{ad-hoc} manner, which lacks theoretical justification, despite the fact that we know that the hyperparameters are not consistently estimable from a single realization and that there is sensitivity to the choice of the prior. We first use the recent Penalised Complexity prior framework to construct a practically useful, tunable, weakly informative joint prior on the range and the marginal variance for Mat\\\u0027ern GRFs with fixed smoothness. We then discuss how to extend this prior to a prior for a non-stationary GRF with covariates in the covariance structure.","title":"Interpretable Priors for Hyperparameters for Gaussian Random Fields","id":273067384,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273067384_Interpretable_Priors_for_Hyperparameters_for_Gaussian_Random_Fields","names":["Geir-Arne Fuglstad","Daniel Simpson","Finn Lindgren","HÃ¥vard Rue"],"references":{"260946444":"Penalising model component complexity: A principled, practical approach to constructing priors","4742474":"Non-Gaussian Bayesian Geostatistical Modeling","227925526":"Bayesian estimation of semi-parametric non-stationary spatial covariance structure","30962641":"Problems With Likelihood Estimation of Covariance Functions of Spatial Gaussian Processes","46537493":"Approximate Bayesian Inference for Latent Gaussian Models by Using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations","223636674":"Asymptotic properties of a maximum likelihood estimator with data from a Gaussian process","45868908":"Adaptive Bayesian estimation using a Gaussian random field with inverse Gamma bandwidth.
