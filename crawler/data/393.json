{"abs":"This chapter begins by describing the basic structure of a Markov chain and how its single-step transition probabilities determine its evolution. For instance, what is the probability of reaching a certain state, and how long does it take to reach it? The next and main part of the chapter characterizes the stationary or equilibrium distribution of Markov chains. These distributions are the basis of limiting averages of various cost and performance parameters associated with Markov chains. Considerable discussion is devoted to branching phenomena, stochastic networks, and time-reversible chains. Included are examples of Markov chains that represent queueing, production systems, inventory control, reliability, and Monte Carlo simulations. Before getting into the main text, a reader would benefit by a brief review of conditional probabilities in Section 1.22 of this chapter and related material on random variables and distributions in Sections 1–4 in the Appendix. The rest of the Appendix, which provides more background on probability, would be appropriate for later reading.","title":"Markov Chains","id":225875372,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225875372_Markov_Chains","names":["J.
