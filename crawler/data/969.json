{"abs":"Parameter estimation for and prediction of spatially or spatio--temporally correlated random processes are used in many areas and often require the solution of a large linear system based on the covariance matrix of the observations. In recent years, the dataset sizes to which these methods are applied have steadily increased such that straightforward statistical tools are computationally too expensive to be used. In the univariate context, tapering, i.e., creating sparse approximate linear systems, has been shown to be an efficient tool in both the estimation and prediction settings. The asymptotic properties are derived under an infill asymptotic setting. In this paper we use a domain increasing framework for estimation and prediction using multivariate tapering. Under this asymptotic regime we prove that tapering (one-tapered form) preserves the consistency of the untapered maximum likelihood estimator and show that tapering has asymptotically the same mean squared prediction error as using the corresponding untapered predictor. The theoretical results are illustrated with simulations.","title":"Asymptotic properties of multivariate tapering for estimation and prediction","id":277895584,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277895584_Asymptotic_properties_of_multivariate_tapering_for_estimation_and_prediction","names":["Reinhard Furrer","François Bachoc","Juan Du"],"references":{"262576230":"Estimation and Prediction in Spatial Models With Block Composite Likelihoods","4993358":"Fixed rank Kriging for very large data sets","228533596":"Nonstationary Positive Definite Tapering On The Plane","26808285":"Gaussian predictive process models for large spatial data sets","270650342":"Equivalence of Gaussian measures of multivariate random fields","4914189":"Approximating likelihoods for large spatial data sets","241722209":"Estimating Space and Space-Time Covariance Functions for Large Data Sets: A Weighted Composite Likelihood Approach","38360256":"Asymptotically Efficient Prediction of a Random Field with a Misspecified Covariance Function","220493172":"Modification of the Minimum-Degree Algorithm by Multiple Elimination.","241724347":"Statistical Properties of Covariance Tapers","242997037":"Efficiency of linear predictors for periodic processes using an incorrect covariance function","38339871":"Predicting random fields with increasing dense observations","47457486":"spam: A Sparse Matrix R Package with Emphasis on MCMC Methods for Gaussian Markov Random Fields","273705292":"Classes of compactly supported covariance functions for multivariate random fields","220390974":"Wendland, H.: Piecewise polynomial, positive definite and compactly supported radial functions of minimal degree.
