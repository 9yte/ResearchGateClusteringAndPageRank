{"abs":"In this article, the Dirichlet process prior is used to provide a nonparametric Bayesian estimate of a vector of normal means. In the past there have been computational difficulties with this model. This article solves the computational difficulties by developing a “Gibbs sampler” algorithm. The estimator developed in this article is then compared to parametric empirical Bayes estimators (PEB) and nonparametric empirical Bayes estimators (NPEB) in a Monte Carlo study. The Monte Carlo study demonstrates that in some conditions the PEB is better than the NPEB and in other conditions the NPEB is better than the PEB. The Monte Carlo study also shows that the estimator developed in this article produces estimates that are about as good as the PEB when the PEB is better and produces estimates that are as good as the NPEB estimator when that method is better.","title":"Estimating Normal Means with a Dirichlet Process Prior","id":238684341,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238684341_Estimating_Normal_Means_with_a_Dirichlet_Process_Prior","names":["Michael David Escobar","Journal of the American Statistical Association"],"references":{"242503284":"The Calculation of Posterior Distributions by Data Augmentation: Rejoinder","239060446":"Estimating the means of several normal populations by estimating the distribution of the means, PhD thesis, Yale University","239037406":"Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimation of a Mixing Distribution","224910629":"Sampling-Based Approaches to Calculate Marginal Densities","243553632":"Using the SIR algorithm to simulate posterior distributions","243784835":"An Empirical Bayes Approach to Statistics","229100480":"Statistical Analysis of Finite Mixture Distributions.John Wiley \u0026 Sons, New York","254284320":"Stein\u0027s Estimation Rule and Its Competitors--An Empirical Bayes Approach","38357634":"A Bayesian Analysis of Some Non-Parametric Problems","250955962":"Computations of Mixtures of Dirichlet Processes","38357862":"Antoniak, C.E.: Mixtures of Dirichlet Processes with Applications to Bayesian Nonparametric Problems.
