{"abs":"Resampling is a critically important operation in the implementation of particle filtering. In parallel hardware implementations, resampling becomes a bottleneck due to its sequential nature and the increased complexity it imposes on the traffic of the designed interconnection network. To circumvent some of these difficulties, we propose two new resampling algorithms. The first one, called residual-systematic resampling, combines the merits of both systematic and residual resampling and is suitable for pipelined implementation. It also guarantees the fixed duration of the resampling procedure irrespective of the weight distribution of the particles. The second algorithm, referred to as partial resampling, has low complexity and reduces traffic load through the hardware network. These two algorithms should also be considered as resampling methods in simulations on standard computers.","title":"New resampling algorithms for particle filters","id":4015429,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4015429_New_resampling_algorithms_for_particle_filters","names":["Miodrag Bolic","Petar M Djuric","Sangjin Hong"],"references":{"3002728":"A fast-weighted Bayesian bootstrap filter for nonlinear model state estimation","3361206":"Novel Approach to Nonlinear/Non-Gaussian Bayesian State Estimation","268209561":"M Carlo Statistical Methods","265681840":"Sequential Imputations and Bayesian Missing Data Problems","226466390":"Funktionen von beschränkter Variatiou in der Theorie der Gleichverteilung","243769869":"Bayesian state estimation for tracking and guidance using the bootstrap filter","27291659":"Probability and Statistics.
