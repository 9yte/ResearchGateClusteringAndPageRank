{"abs":"Reliability evaluation methods based on directional simulation for structural reliability analysis is treated herein. The methods can be used to check results obtained by a first- or second-order reliability method. Directional importance sampling based on first- and second-order reliability results is used to reduce the variance on the probability estimator. Sampling densities and procedures for important types of failure surfaces considered in the space of independent and standardized Gaussian variables are set up. The types include hyperspheres, hyperplanes, rotationally symmetrical hyperparaboloids, surfaces defining a convex polyhedral failure set, as well as series-systems failure surfaces.","title":"Probability Integration by Directional Simulation","id":273800355,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273800355_Probability_Integration_by_Directional_Simulation","names":["Peter Bjerager","Journal of Engineering Mechanics"],"references":{"284152515":"Numerical evaluation of the error term in Breitung\u0027s formula"},"citedIn":{"222478914":"Reliability analysis of wind-sensitive structures","233922289":"Reliability Based Optimal Design of Structures Using Competitive Genetic Algorithms","226684550":"Limit state reliability optimization accounting for geometric effects","225697401":"Developments in stochastic structural mechanics","277153422":"A GENERIC RELIABILITY ANALYSIS AND DESIGN FRAMEWORK WITH RANDOM PARAMETER, FIELD, AND PROCESS VARIABLES","44029587":"Parametric uncertainties in reliability analysis of bridge structures","222584138":"Stability likelihood of coalitions in a two-stage cartel game: An estimation method","269777947":"Cumulative PSO-Kriging model for slope reliability analysis","248607680":"An original sensitivity statistic within a new adaptive accelerated Monte-Carlo method","222289965":"On Computation Methods for Structural Reliability Analysis","239373143":"Sample-specific linearization in reliability analysis of off-shore structures","256522334":"Vector outcrossing probabilities by Monte Carlo","223407941":"Selective sampling in simulation-based reliability assessment","228535177":"Adaptive importance sampling method for the stochastic finite element analysis","224815999":"High-dimensional model representation for structural reliability analysis","229817257":"Structural Reliability Assessment with Ambiguity and Vagueness in Failure","286401545":"Probabilistic Computational Methods in Structural Failure Analysis","222604889":"Computational stochastic analysis of earth structure settlements","229631665":"Calibration of Structural Models Using Fuzzy Mathematics","222266142":"Computational stochastic mechanics - Recent advances","223858805":"Rackwitz, R.: A benchmark study on importance sampling techniques in structural reliability.
