{"abs":"The use of the Gibbs sampler as a method for calculating Bayesian marginal posterior and predictive densities is reviewed and illustrated with a range of normal data models, including variance components, unordered and ordered means, hierarchical growth curves, and missing data in a crossover trial. In all cases the approach is straightforward to specify distributionally and to implement computationally, with output readily adapted for required inference summaries.","title":"Illustration of Bayesian Inference in Normal Data Models Using Gibbs Sampling","id":243689785,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243689785_Illustration_of_Bayesian_Inference_in_Normal_Data_Models_Using_Gibbs_Sampling","names":["Alan E.
