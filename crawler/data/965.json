{"abs":"We establish a stochastic nonlinear analogue of the Perron- Frobenius theorem on eigenvalues and eigenvectors of positive matrices. The result is formulated in terms of an automorphism T of a probability space (›;F;P) and a random mapping D(!;¢) : Rn + ! Rn +. Under assumptions of monotonicity and homogeneity of D(!;¢), we prove the existence of scalar and vec- tor measurable functions fi(!) \u003e 0 and x(!) \u003e 0 satisfying the equation fi(!)x(T!) \u003d D(!;x(!)) almost surely.","title":"STOCHASTIC NONLINEAR PERRON-FROBENIUS","id":239534044,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239534044_STOCHASTIC_NONLINEAR_PERRON-FROBENIUS","names":["Sergey Pirogov"],"references":{"243102270":"Rapid Growth Paths in Convex-Valued Random Dynamical Systems","24055707":"Exponential, Growth of Fixed-Mix Strategies in Stationary Asset Markets","226093215":"Perron-Frobenius theorem, large deviations, and random perturbations in random environments","2098886":"The Perron-Frobenius Theorem for Homogeneous, Monotone Functions","243075429":"Extensions of Jentzsch\u0027s Theorem","256557425":"The Perron-Frobenius Theorem without Additivity","225781817":"Random dynamical systems","2827654":"Evolutionary Formalism for Products of Positive Random Matrices","245529532":"A stochastic contraction principle","44478088":"Non-negative matrices and markov chains / E.
