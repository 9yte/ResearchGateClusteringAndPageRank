{"abs":"In this paper, we show an original application of the Subset Simulation (SS) technique on a model for the performance assessment of a near surface radioactive waste repository. The logic of the protective barriers of the repository is represented by a reliability model. The SS approach is founded on the idea that a small failure probability can be expressed as a product of larger conditional probabilities of some intermediate events; with a proper choice of the conditional events, the conditional probabilities can be sufficiently large to allow accurate estimation with a small number of samples. In the application, the method allows improving the efficiency of the random sampling for estimating the repository containment failure probability. Moreover, the peculiar set-partitioning scheme of the SS method is exploited for performing the analysis of the sensitivity of the failure probability estimate to the uncertain model parameters.","title":"Subset Simulation of a reliability model for radioactive waste repository performance assessment","id":257391812,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257391812_Subset_Simulation_of_a_reliability_model_for_radioactive_waste_repository_performance_assessment","names":["Francesco Cadini","Diana Avram","Nicola Pedroni","Enrico Zio","Reliability Engineering [?] System Safety"],"references":{"222600325":"Augmenting approximate solutions for consistent reliability analysis","267622577":"A Preliminary Postclosure Safety Assessment of OPG’s Proposed L\u0026ILW Deep Geologic Repository, Canada","222814884":"Application of line sampling simulation method to reliability benchmark problems","200622065":"Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines","222156059":"Monte Carlo-based assessment of the safety performance of a radioactive waste repository","222378983":"The role of the design point for calculating failure probabilities in view of dimensionality and structural nonlinearities","222835342":"Estimation of the functional failure probability of a thermal–hydraulic passive system by Subset Simulation","223647036":"Probabilistic safety assessment model for near surface radioactive waste disposal facilities","46493900":"A path sampling identity for computing the Kullback-Leibler and J divergences","223168999":"Reliability of structures in high dimensions, Part I: Algorithms and applications","223944114":"Reliability-based design sensitivity by efficient simulation","229384999":"A two-stage Subset Simulation-based approach for calculating the reliability of inelastic structural systems subjected to Gaussian random excitations","261547897":"Compartment fire risk analysis by advanced Monte Carlo simulation","228591568":"Subset Simulation and its Application to Seismic Risk Based on Dynamic Analysis","221669734":"Equations of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines","222546544":"Estimation of Small Failure Probabilities in High Dimensions by Subset Simulation","265361410":"An introduction to the basics of reliability and risk analysis","222911102":"A generic probabilistic risk assessment for low level waste burial grounds","284682912":"Subset simulation and its application to probabilistic seismic performance assessment","223402504":"Risk assessment for shallow land burial of low level radioactive waste","222672830":"Benchmark study on reliability estimation in higher dimensions of structural systems – An overview","222391834":"Monte Carlo estimation of radionuclide release at a repository scale","245210913":"Application of spherical subset simulation method and auxiliary domain method on a benchmark reliability study","223325330":"Hybrid Subset Simulation Method for Reliability Estimation of Dynamical Systems Subject to Stochastic Excitation"},"citedIn":{"273206504":"Estimation of passive systems functional failure probabilities by the modified meta-IS algorithm","290522656":"A generalized surrogate response aided-subset simulation approach for efficient geotechnical reliability-based design","281144371":"Rare Event Simulation","264349943":"Passive systems failure probability estimation by the meta-AK-IS2 algorithm","268038033":"Improved metamodel-based importance sampling for the performance assessment of radioactive waste repositories","281913142":"Risk and Reliability Analysis of Multibarrier System for Near-Surface Disposal Facilities","273395126":"Extracting Rare Failure Events in Composite System Reliability Evaluation Via Subset Simulation","281770821":"Engineering Risk Assessment with Subset Simulation","263545787":"Asymptotic optimality of RESTART estimators in highly dependable systems","263666649":"An improved adaptive kriging-based importance technique for sampling multiple failure regions of low probability"},"index":587}
