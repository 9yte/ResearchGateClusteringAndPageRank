{"abs":"In this paper a grey-box model of a nonlinear dynamical system is constructed. This involves using a Gaussian process to emulate model error-the error that arises as a result of flaws in one\u0027s physical-law based model of the system. The work shows how such an approach can be extended towards dynamical systems. Specifically, it is applied to experimental data, obtained from a dynamical system whose response is known to be strongly influenced by friction effects.","title":"Grey-box modelling of a friction-affected dynamical system","id":283579092,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283579092_Grey-box_modelling_of_a_friction-affected_dynamical_system","names":["Peter L Green","Mehdi Hendijanizadeh","S J Elliott"],"references":{"223225199":"Defining predictive maturity for validated numerical simulations","227138491":"A Forecasting Metric for Predictive Modeling","267024664":"Nonlinear damping in an energy harvesting device","4772045":"Bayesian Calibration of Computer Models","248512106":"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Errata","278156450":"Learning about physical parameters: The importance of model discrepancy","239667584":"A Framework for Validation of Computer Models","4742946":"Computer Model Calibration Using High-Dimensional Output","275031247":"Probabilistic modelling of a rotational energy harvester","281260655":"Bayesian and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for identifying nonlinear systems in the presence of uncertainty"},"citedIn":{},"index":650}
