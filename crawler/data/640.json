{"abs":"This accessible new edition explores the major topics in Monte Carlo simulation Simulation and the Monte Carlo Method, Second Edition reflects the latest developments in the field and presents a fully updated and comprehensive account of the major topics that have emerged in Monte Carlo simulation since the publication of the classic First Edition over twenty-five years ago. While maintaining its accessible and intuitive approach, this revised edition features a wealth of up-to-date information that facilitates a deeper understanding of problem solving across a wide array of subject areas, such as engineering, statistics, computer science, mathematics, and the physical and life sciences. The book begins with a modernized introduction that addresses the basic concepts of probability, Markov processes, and convex optimization. Subsequent chapters discuss the dramatic changes that have occurred in the field of the Monte Carlo method, with coverage of many modern topics including: Markov Chain Monte Carlo Variance reduction techniques such as the transform likelihood ratio method and the screening method The score function method for sensitivity analysis The stochastic approximation method and the stochastic counter-part method for Monte Carlo optimization The cross-entropy method to rare events estimation and combinatorial optimization Application of Monte Carlo techniques for counting problems, with an emphasis on the parametric minimum cross-entropy method An extensive range of exercises is provided at the end of each chapter, with more difficult sections and exercises marked accordingly for advanced readers. A generous sampling of applied examples is positioned throughout the book, emphasizing various areas of application, and a detailed appendix presents an introduction to exponential families, a discussion of the computational complexity of stochastic programming problems, and sample MATLAB programs. Requiring only a basic, introductory knowledge of probability and statistics, Simulation and the Monte Carlo Method, Second Edition is an excellent text for upper-undergraduate and beginning graduate courses in simulation and Monte Carlo techniques. The book also serves as a valuable reference for professionals who would like to achieve a more formal understanding of the Monte Carlo method.","title":"Simulation and the Monte Carlo Method","id":210222819,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/210222819_Simulation_and_the_Monte_Carlo_Method","names":["Reuven Y Rubinstein","Dirk P Kroese"],"references":{"242929962":"Penalty Functions and Duality in Stochastic Programming Via Divergence Functionals","3152250":"Quick estimation of rare events in stochastic networks","225694233":"How Many Needles are in a Haystack, or How to Solve #P-Complete Counting Problems Fast","220430972":"Simulating Stable Stochastic Systems, II: Markov Chains"},"citedIn":{"257512282":"The Utility of a Composite Biological Endpoint in HIV/STI Prevention Trials","280555707":"Probabilistic Analysis of Contaminant Transport via Monte Carlo Simulation","266200025":"Current Assessment of Integrated Content of Long-Lived Radionuclides in Soils of the Head Part of the East Ural Radioactive Trace","220780844":"Real-time models supporting resource management decisions in highly variable systems","235345410":"Vessel routing and scheduling under uncertainty in the liquefied natural gas business","245249691":"Automated Planning and Policy Learning for Surveillance Missions","257451870":"A hybrid reliability model for structures with truncated probability distributions","263504818":"Advanced Numerical and Analytical Methods for Assessing Concrete Sewers and Their Remaining Service Life","285311238":"Probabilistic analysis of a containment vessel subjected to dynamic pressure loading using surrogate models","255171388":"Reliability Sensitivity Analysis via the Likelihood Ratio Method","262402989":"Combining Time and Frequency Domain Specifications for Periodic Signals","222983493":"Reliability and Sensitivity Analysis of Transonic Flutter Using Improved Line Sampling Technique","257673044":"Supply–Demand Risk and Resilience Assessment for Household Rainwater Harvesting in Melbourne, Australia","284175584":"Probabilistic waveform inversion for 22 earthquake moment tensors in Hungary: new constraints on the tectonic stress pattern inside the Pannonian basin","235721245":"Probabilistic Indicators of Structural Redundancy in Mechanics","220742973":"Bloat control in genetic programming with a histogram-based accept-reject method.","285311256":"Échantillonnage préférentiel quasi-optimal par krigeage pour l’évaluation de la fiabilité des cuves de réacteur à eau pressurisée","264049572":"CUIRRE: An open-source library for load balancing and characterizing irregular applications on GPUs","261123978":"Scaling the Distributed Stochastic Simulation to Exaflop Supercomputers","234140136":"Monte Carlo Inference via Greedy Importance Sampling","277288089":"6.
