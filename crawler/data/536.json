{"abs":"The trade-off between obtaining a good distribution of Pareto-optimal solutions and obtaining them in a small computational time is an important issue in evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO). It has been well established in the EMO literature that although SPEA produces a better distribution compared to NSGA-II, the computational time needed to run SPEA is much larger. In this paper, we suggest a clustered NSGA-II which uses an identical clustering technique to that used in SPEA for obtaining a better distribution. Moreover, we propose a steady-state MOEA based on ε-dominance concept and effcient parent and archive update strategies. Based on a comparative study on a number of two and three objective test problems, it is observed that the steady-state MOEA achieves a comparable distribution to the clustered NSGA-II with a much less computational time.","title":"Towards a Quick Computation of Well-Spread Pareto-Optimal Solutions","id":221228621,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221228621_Towards_a_Quick_Computation_of_Well-Spread_Pareto-Optimal_Solutions","names":["Kalyan Deb","Manikanth Mohan","Shikhar Mishra"],"references":{"3949503":"Scalable multi-objective optimization test problems","235709769":"Evaluating the quality of approximation to the non-dominated set","2240388":"Thiele, L.: Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms: A Comparative Case Study and the Strength Pareto Approach.
