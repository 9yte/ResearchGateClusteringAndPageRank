{"abs":"In recent years, a gradual increase in the sophistication of multiobjective evolutionary algo- rithms (MOEAs) for Pareto optimization has been seen, accompanied by an ever-growing list of applications. Despite this trend, however, the proposition that methods based on local search may be a good alternative approach -- with the advantages of ease-of-use and lower computational overhead -- has not been thoroughly tested. In this thesis we develop a novel, local-sear\u0026 algorithm for Pareto optimization, called PAES, enabling us to test and compare MOEAs against this philosophically different search method.","title":"Local-Search and Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithms for Pareto Optimization","id":2570964,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2570964_Local-Search_and_Hybrid_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Pareto_Optimization","names":["Joshua Damian Knowles"],"references":{"201976841":"Memetic Algorithms: A Short Introduction","23740136":"When Will a Genetic Algorithm Outperform Hill-Climbing?","2247968":"The Royal Road for Genetic Algorithms: Fitness Landscapes and GA Performance","222482116":"Parallel recombinative simulated annealing: A genetic algorithm","2359458":"The Link and Node Biased Encoding Revisited: Bias and Adjustment of Parameters","2629039":"Approximating the Nondominated Front Using the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy","236389661":"Heuristics: Intelligent Search Strategies for Computer Problem Solving","220118677":"Optimization by Simulated Annealing","2642725":"Evaluating the Quality of Approximations to the Non-Dominated Set","2295598":"Fitness Landscapes and Memetic Algorithm Design","221619640":"Stochastic Hillclimbing as a Baseline Mathod for Evaluating Genetic Algorithms.","2357164":"A New Evolutionary Approach to the Degree Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree Problem","2280242":"Future Generation Computer Systems","228057735":"Computers and Intractability: A Guide to NP-Completeness","2333106":"Simulated Binary Crossover for Continuous Search Space","225218685":"A New Genetic Algorithm for the Optimal Communication Spanning Tree Problem","224839796":"Using Genetic Algorithms to Solve a Multi-Objective Ground-Water Monitoring Problem","216300535":"A fast elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization: NSGA-II.
