{"abs":"We introduce a generalization of the Adaptive Multilevel Splitting algorithm in the discrete time dynamic setting, namely when it is applied to sample rare events associated with paths of Markov chains. By interpreting the algorithm as a sequential sampler in path space, we are able to build an estimator of the rare event probability (and of any non-normalized quantity associated with this event) which is unbiased, whatever the choice of the importance function and the number of replicas. This has practical consequences on the use of this algorithm, which are illustrated through various numerical experiments.","title":"Unbiasedness of some generalized Adaptive Multilevel Splitting algorithms","id":276211339,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276211339_Unbiasedness_of_some_generalized_Adaptive_Multilevel_Splitting_algorithms","names":["Charles-Edouard Bréhier","Gazeau Maxime","Ludovic Goudenège","Tony Lelièvre","Rousset Mathias"],"references":{"37616984":"On the Importance Function in Splitting Simulation","49819199":"A multiple replica approach to simulate reactive trajectories","265127940":"Fluctuation Analysis of Adaptive Multilevel Splitting","262108949":"Analysis of Adaptive Multilevel Splitting algorithms in an idealized case","264854211":"Combinatorial analysis of the adaptive last particle method","3023205":"A large deviations perspective on the efficiency of multilevel splitting","200707517":"Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers for Rare Events","226031060":"Sequential Monte Carlo for rare event estimation","245199761":"Adaptive Multilevel Splitting for Rare Event Analysis","274908686":"Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus.","269417762":"Statistical behavior of adaptive multilevel splitting algorithms in simple models","200744518":"Sequential Monte-Carlo Methods in Practice","234999699":"Reaction paths based on mean first-passage times","6825981":"Illustration of transition path theory on a collection of simple examples","272793915":"Large deviations principle for the Adaptive Multilevel Splitting Algorithm in an idealized setting","267448713":"Central Limit Theorem for Adaptive Multilevel Splitting Estimators in an Idealized Setting","225348983":"Simulation and Estimation of Extreme Quantiles and Extreme Probabilities"},"citedIn":{"284750937":"Rare event simulation and spliting for discontinuous random variables","283810285":"Recent advances in various fields of numerical probability","279808481":"Rare Event Simulation and Splitting for Discontinuous Random Variables"},"index":289}
