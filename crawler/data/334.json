{"abs":"We consider design issues in a polynomial regression model where the variance of the response depends on the independent variable exponentially. However, this dependence is not known precisely and additional parameters are required in the model. Our design criteria permit various subsets of the parameters to be estimated with different emphasis. Bayesian D -optimal designs on a compact interval, with the number of support points restricted to be one more than the degree of the polynomial, are found analytically for a large class of priors. These designs may or may not be optimal within the class of all designs, depending on the prior distribution.","title":"Bayesian D-optimal designs on a fixed number of design points for heteroscedastic polynomial models","id":31373630,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31373630_Bayesian_D-optimal_designs_on_a_fixed_number_of_design_points_for_heteroscedastic_polynomial_models","names":["Holger Dette","Weng Kee Wong","Biometrika"],"references":{"222746918":"Bayesian optimal one point designs for one parameter nonlinear models","38359146":"Optimal Designs for Trigonometric and Polynomial Regression Using Canonical Moments","247249048":"Principal representations and canonical moment sequences for distributions on an interval","38358605":"$D_s$-Optimal Designs for Polynomial Regression Using Continued Fractions","245775938":"Constrained optimal designs for regressiom models","223683134":"Constrained optimal designs","222314446":"A note on optimal Bayesian design for nonlinear problems","31102548":"Diagnostics for Heteroscedasticiy in Regression","223753350":"Bayesian D-optimal designs for exponential regression models","238806859":"On an extremal problem of Fej�r","265437707":"On the Equivalence of Constrained and Compound Optimal Designs","38348944":"Optimal Bayesian designs for models with partially specified heteroscedastic structure","222492574":"Bayesian D-optimal designs for the exponential growth model","38363031":"Bayesian Experimental Design: A Review","266368670":"Optimal Product Designs for Multivariate Regression with missing Terms"},"citedIn":{"23521635":"Optimal Design Robust to a Misspecified Model","228909901":"Optimal design of experiments with possibly failing trials","35173969":"Klassische orthogonale Polynome und ihre Anwendung in der optimalen Versuchsplanung [Elektronische Ressource] /","278447633":"Recent advances in multiple-objective design strategies","266857128":"Finding Bayesian Optimal Designs for Nonlinear Models: A Semidefinite Programming-Based Approach","228784242":"Bayesian Minimally Supported D -Optimal Designs for an Exponential Regression Model","257199236":"Locally D-optimal designs for multistage models and heteroscedastic polynomial regression models","222214031":"Macchietto, S.: Model-based design of experiments for parameter precision: State of the art.
