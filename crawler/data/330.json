{"abs":"We present a version of Elfving\u0027s theorem for the Bayesian D-optimality criterion in nonlinear regression models. The Bayesian optimal design can be characterized as a design which allows a representation of a (uniquely determined) boundary point of a convex subset of $L^2$-integrable functions. A similar characterization is given for the Bayesian c-optimality criterion where a (possible) nonlinear function of the unknown parameters has to be estimated. The results are illustrated in the example of an exponential growth model using a gamma prior distribution.","title":"A note on Bayesian c- and D-optimal designs in nonlinear regression models","id":38348739,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38348739_A_note_on_Bayesian_c-_and_D-optimal_designs_in_nonlinear_regression_models","names":["Holger Dette","The Annals of Statistics"],"references":{"222746918":"Bayesian optimal one point designs for one parameter nonlinear models","260161345":"The Use of a Canonical Form in the Construction of Locally Optimal Designs for Non-Linear Problems","221956664":"Bayesian design for accelerated life testing","223350547":"Optimal Bayesian design applied to logistic regression","266524263":"Elfving\u0027s Theorem for $D$-Optimality","243049392":"Bayesian design for estimating the turning point of a quadratic regression","230873103":"Experimental Design in a Class of Models","222314446":"A note on optimal Bayesian design for nonlinear problems","38367355":"Locally Optimal Designs for Estimating Parameters","254332316":"Model Robust, Linear-Optimal Designs","222247365":"Robust experiment design via stochastic approximation","267149623":"The role of symmetry and approximation in exact design optimality","38367477":"Optimum Allocation in Linear Regression Theory","38364149":"Elfving\u0027s Theorem and Optimal Designs for Quadratic Loss","266256515":"Problems and approaches in design of experiments for estimation and testing in non-linear models"},"citedIn":{"4742505":"Optimal Designs for DoseResponse Models With Restricted Design Spaces","51193711":"A geometric characterization of optimal designs for regression models with correlated observations","259266006":"On the Choice of a Prior for Bayesian D-Optimal Designs for the Logistic Regression Model with a Single Predictor","28354325":"Geometric construction of optimal design for dose-response models with two parameters","37999721":"Sequential optimization through adaptive design of experiments","242997681":"A geometric method for singular c-optimal designs","268625769":"Optimal design for prediction in multiresponse linear models based on rectangular confidence region","51949620":"A New Characterization of Elfving\u0027s Method for High Dimensional\nComputation","45130754":"Geometric construction of optimal designs for dose-responsemodels with two parameters","283181330":"Bayesian D-optimal design for logistic regression model with exponential distribution for random intercept","226635575":"Sequential experimental design and response optimisation","4749693":"Maximin D-optimal designs for binary longitudinal responses","250396091":"SEQUENTIAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND EXTREMUM CONTROL","4750207":"Finding Near-Optimal Bayesian Experimental Designs via Genetic Algorithms","250754766":"Review of optimal Bayes designs","228750015":"Universal Optimality of Bayesian Experimental Designs and Optimal Data Augmentations","256918414":"Fast estimation of expected information gains for Bayesian experimental designs based on Laplace approximations","38363031":"Bayesian Experimental Design: A Review","233355734":"Highly Efficient Designs for Logistic Models with Categorical Variables","250754765":"28 Model robust designs"},"index":330}
