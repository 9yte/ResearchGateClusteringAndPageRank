{"abs":"A method is developed to successively find the multiple design points of a component reliability problem, when they exist on the limit-state surface. FORM or SORM approximations at each design point followed by a series system reliability analysis is shown to lead to improved estimates of the failure probability. Three example applications show the generality and robustness of the method.","title":"Multiple design points in first and second-order
