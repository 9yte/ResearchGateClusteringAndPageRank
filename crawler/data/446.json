{"abs":"A comprehensive framework is set forth for the analysis of structural reliability under incomplete probability information. Under stipulated requirements of consistency, invariance, operability, and simplicity, a method is developed to incorporate in the reliability analysis incomplete probability information on random variables, including moments, bounds, marginal distributions, and partial joint distributions. The method is consistent with the philosophy of Ditlevsen\u0027s generalized reliability index and complements existing second-moment and full-distribution structural reliability theories.","title":"Structural reliability under incomplete probability information.
