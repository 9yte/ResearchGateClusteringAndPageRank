{"abs":"The Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) (Zitzler and Thiele 1999) is a relatively recent technique for finding or approximating the Pareto-optimal set for multiobjective optimization problems. In different studies (Zitzler and Thiele 1999; Zitzler, Deb, and Thiele 2000) SPEA has shown very good performance in comparison to other multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, and therefore it has been a point of reference in various recent investigations, e.g., (Corne, Knowles, and Oates 2000). Furthermore, it has been used in different applications, e.g., (Lahanas, Milickovic, Baltas, and Zamboglou 2001). In this paper, an improved version, namely SPEA2, is proposed, which incorporates in contrast to its predecessor a fine-grained fitness assignment strategy, a density estimation technique, and an enhanced archive truncation method. The comparison of SPEA2 with SPEA and two other modern elitist methods, PESA and NSGA-II, on different test problems yields promising results. 1","title":"SPEA2: Improving the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm","id":2386811,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2386811_SPEA2_Improving_the_Strength_Pareto_Evolutionary_Algorithm","names":["Eckart Zitzler","Marco Laumanns","Lothar Thiele"],"references":{"220381153":"On the performance of multiple-objective genetic local search on the 0/1 knapsack problem—a comparative experiment","2377646":"Evolutionary Algorithms for Multiobjective Optimization","221228580":"Application of Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms for Dose Optimization Problems in Brachytherapy","3575291":"A Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization","2333106":"Simulated Binary Crossover for Continuous Search Space","216300535":"A fast elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization: NSGA-II.
