{"abs":"A simple approximation for the bivariate normal distribution function is described, together with a second-order refinement. For the absolute value of the correlation coefficient less than or equal to 0Â·9, the worst error is about 10% arising when both arguments of the distribution function are equal, but over most of the range the agreement is much closer. An extension to trivariate normal integrals has similar good properties.","title":"A Simple Approximation for Bivariate and Trivariate Normal Integrals","id":236586737,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236586737_A_Simple_Approximation_for_Bivariate_and_Trivariate_Normal_Integrals","names":["D.R.
