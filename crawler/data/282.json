{"abs":"A key problem in the application of kriging is the definition of a local neighborhood in which to search for the most relevant data. A usual practice consists in selecting data close to the location targeted for prediction and, at the same time, distributed as uniformly as possible around this location, in order to discard data conveying redundant information. This approach may however not be optimal, insofar as it does not account for the data spatial correlation. To improve the kriging neighborhood definition, we first examine the effect of including one or more data and present equations in order to quickly update the kriging weights and kriging variances. These equations are then applied to design a stepwise selection algorithm that progressively incorporates the most relevant data, i.e., the data that make the kriging variance decrease more. The proposed algorithm is illustrated on a soil contamination dataset.","title":"The kriging update equations and their application to the selection of neighboring data","id":225331924,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225331924_The_kriging_update_equations_and_their_application_to_the_selection_of_neighboring_data","names":["Xavier Emery","Computational Geosciences"],"references":{"220330080":"An Algorithm for Finding Nearest Neighbors","224839908":"An Introduction to Applied Geostatics","35703524":"Optimal network designs in spatial statistics [microform].","38348334":"The screening effect in Kriging","226729028":"Two key parameters when choosing the kriging neighborhood","233648357":"Multivariate Geostatistics â€“ An Introduction With Applications","222061078":"Constrained Optimisation of Soil Sampling for Minimisation of the Kriging Variance","291230833":"Quantitative kriging neighbourhood analysis for the mining geologist - A description of the method with worked case examples","240338872":"The Theory of Regionalized Variables and Its Application","228077459":"Geostatistics: Modeling Spatial Uncertainty.
