{"abs":"The interest in nonparametric statistical analysis has grown recently in the field of computational intelligence. In many experimental studies, the lack of the required properties for a proper application of parametric procedures–independence, normality, and homoscedasticity–yields to nonparametric ones the task of performing a rigorous comparison among algorithms.In this paper, we will discuss the basics and give a survey of a complete set of nonparametric procedures developed to perform both pairwise and multiple comparisons, for multi-problem analysis. The test problems of the CEC’2005 special session on real parameter optimization will help to illustrate the use of the tests throughout this tutorial, analyzing the results of a set of well-known evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms. This tutorial is concluded with a compilation of considerations and recommendations, which will guide practitioners when using these tests to contrast their experimental results.","title":"A practical tutorial on the use of nonprametric statistical tests as a methodology for comparing evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithm","id":220514416,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220514416_A_practical_tutorial_on_the_use_of_nonprametric_statistical_tests_as_a_methodology_for_comparing_evolutionary_and_swarm_intelligence_algorithm","names":["Joaquín Derrac","Salvador García","Daniel Molina","Francisco Herrera","Swarm and Evolutionary Computation"],"references":{"31435615":"“A Stagewise Rejective Multiple Test Procedure Based on a Modified Bonferroni Test.”","222714823":"Handbook of Mathematical Function: With Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables","266274397":"The analysis of variance.
