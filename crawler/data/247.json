{"abs":"The term ``sequential Monte Carlo methods\u0027\u0027 or, equivalently, ``particle filters,\u0027\u0027 refers to a general class of iterative algorithms that performs Monte Carlo approximations of a given sequence of distributions of interest (\\pi_t). We establish in this paper a central limit theorem for the Monte Carlo estimates produced by these computational methods. This result holds under minimal assumptions on the distributions \\pi_t, and applies in a general framework which encompasses most of the sequential Monte Carlo methods that have been considered in the literature, including the resample-move algorithm of Gilks and Berzuini [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat. Methodol. 63 (2001) 127-146] and the residual resampling scheme. The corresponding asymptotic variances provide a convenient measurement of the precision of a given particle filter. We study, in particular, in some typical examples of Bayesian applications, whether and at which rate these asymptotic variances diverge in time, in order to assess the long term reliability of the considered algorithm.","title":"Central Limit Theorem for sequential Monte Carlo methods and its application to Bayesian inference","id":2121967,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2121967_Central_Limit_Theorem_for_sequential_Monte_Carlo_methods_and_its_application_to_Bayesian_inference","names":["Nicolas Chopin","The Annals of Statistics"],"references":{"2745576":"Mixture Kalman Filter","2125794":"Recursive Monte Carlo filters: Algorithms and theoretical analysis","3361206":"Novel Approach to Nonlinear/Non-Gaussian Bayesian State Estimation","226280691":"A particle approximation of the solution of the Kushner–Stratonovitch equation","2836794":"Population Monte Carlo","2453431":"A Sequential Particle Filter Method for Static Models","222892188":"On the stability of interacting processes with applications to filtering and geneticÂ algorithms","2369650":"“Filtering Via Simulation: Auxiliary Particle Filter”","220885628":"Reducing Bias and Inefficienry in the Selection Algorithm.","236853512":"State Space and Hidden Markov Models","225136380":"Branching and Interacting Particle Systems Approximations of Feynman–Kac Formulae with Applications to Non-linear Filtering","245529722":"Minimal Entropy Approximations and Optimal Algorithms","2590205":"Sequential Monte Carlo Methods for Dynamic Systems","1825409":"Sequential monte carlo samplers","2439039":"Convergence of Sequential Monte Carlo Methods","38340117":"Stability and Uniform Approximation of Nonlinear Filters using the Hilbert Metric, and Application to Particle Filters","2425017":"A Genetic Algorithm Tutorial","23977648":"Sequential Inference and State Number Determination for Discrete State-Space Models through Particle Filtering","3357548":"An improved particle filter for non-linear problems.
