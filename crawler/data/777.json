{"abs":"Nowadays the tempo of modern life is very fast which prevents parents from their regular contact with schools. We have developed an application, more precisely, an electronic grade (e-grade) book which enables the parents to monitor and control their child\u0027s education. By entering the username and password the parents would have an insight into their child\u0027s grades, inexcusable absence, test dates, cultural, sport days, natural science days, teachers\u0027 notes to the parents and so on. This paper shows an example of an e-grade book on the internet as well as the advantages and disadvantages a possible introduction of an e-grade in primary schools might bring about. Teachers\u0027 and parents\u0027 response to a possible introduction of an e-grade book is also presented.","title":"Assesing the Potential Impact of an Electronic Grade System to the School Environment.","id":220166319,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220166319_Assesing_the_Potential_Impact_of_an_Electronic_Grade_System_to_the_School_Environment","names":["Eva Jereb","Teja Toman"],"references":{"264322820":"Introduction: Cyberspace and geographical space"},"citedIn":{"242286565":"EDITORIAL BOARDS, PUBLISHING COUNCIL"},"index":777}
