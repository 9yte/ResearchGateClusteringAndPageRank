{"abs":"As modeling efforts expand to a broader spectrum of areas the amount of computer time required to exercise the corresponding computer codes has become quite costly (several hours for a single run is not uncommon). This costly process can be directly tied to the complexity of the modeling and to the large number of input variables (often numbering in the hundreds) Further, the complexity of the modeling (usually involving systems of differential equations) makes the relationships among the input variables not mathematically tractable. In this setting it is desired to perform sensitivity studies of the input-output relationships. Hence, a judicious selection procedure for the choic of values of input variables is required, Latin hypercube sampling has been shown to work well on this type of problem.","title":"Small Sample Sensitivity Analysis Techniques For Computer-Models, With An Application To Risk Assessment","id":238394232,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238394232_Small_Sample_Sensitivity_Analysis_Techniques_For_Computer-Models_With_An_Application_To_Risk_Assessment","names":["Ronald L.
