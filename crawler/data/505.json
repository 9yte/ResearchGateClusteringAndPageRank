{"abs":"We generalize the elementary mechanism of sampling with replacement $N$ times from a weighted population of size $N$, by introducing auxiliary variables and constraints on conditional independence characterised by modular congruence relations. Motivated by considerations of parallelism, a convergence study reveals how sparsity of the mechanism\u0027s conditional independence graph is related to fluctuation properties of particle filters which use it for resampling, in some cases exhibiting exotic scaling behaviour. The proofs involve detailed combinatorial analysis of conditional independence graphs.","title":"Butterfly resampling: asymptotics for particle filters with constrained interactions","id":268689539,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268689539_Butterfly_resampling_asymptotics_for_particle_filters_with_constrained_interactions","names":["Kari Heine","Nick Whiteley","Ali Taylan Cemgil","Hakan Guldas"],"references":{"2125794":"Recursive Monte Carlo filters: Algorithms and theoretical analysis","220692229":"Models of Computation: Exploring the Power of Computing","267046446":"Convergence properties of weighted particle islands with application to the double bootstrap algorithm","3361206":"Novel Approach to Nonlinear/Non-Gaussian Bayesian State Estimation","29617444":"A non asymptotic variance theorem for unnormalized Feynman-Kac particle models","222091995":"Long-term stability of sequential Monte Carlo methods under verifiable\nconditions","256487681":"On the role of interaction in sequential Monte Carlo algorithms","38339872":"Central limit theorem for nonlinear filtering and interacting particle systems","2121967":"Central Limit Theorem for sequential Monte Carlo methods and its application to Bayesian inference","51942167":"Stability properties of some particle filters","265621125":"Parallel and Distributed Computation: Numerical Methods","3318241":"A Survey of Convergence Results on Particle Filtering Methods for Practitioners","51720230":"On the Utility of Graphics Cards to Perform Massively Parallel Simulation of Advanced Monte Carlo Methods","242608512":"Introduction to Parallel Algorithms and Architectures: Array, Trees, Hypercubes","228721976":"Limit theorems for weighted samples with applications to Sequential Monte Carlo Methods","265986977":"Interacting Particle Filtering with Discrete-Time Observations: Asymptotic Behaviour in the Gaussian Case","238951685":"On parallel implementation of Sequential Monte Carlo methods: the island particle model","45352072":"On the asymptotic variance in the Central Limit Theorem for particle filters","257200203":"Topics in Matrix Analysis, Section 6.1"},"citedIn":{"288178655":"A practical introduction to butterfly and adaptive resampling in Sequential Monte Carlo"},"index":505}
