{"abs":"It is a common engineering practice to use approximate models instead of the original computationally expensive model in optimization. When an approximate model is used for evolutionary optimization, the convergence properties of the evolutionary algorithm are unclear due to the approximation error. In this paper, extensive empirical studies on convergence of an evolution strategy are carried out on two bench-mark problems. It is found that incorrect convergence will occur if the approximate model has false optima. To address this problem, individual and generation based evolution control is introduced and the resulting effects on the convergence properties are presented. A framework for managing approximate models in generation-based evolution control is proposed. This framework is well suited for parallel evolutionary optimization that is able to guarantee the correct convergence of the evolutionary algorithm and to reduce the computation costs as much as possible.
