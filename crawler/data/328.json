{"abs":"The normative procedure for the design of an experiment is to select a utility function, assess the probabilities, and to choose that design of maximum expected utility. One difficulty with this view is that a scientist typically does not have, nor can be normally expected to have, a clear idea of the utility of his results. An alternative is to design an experiment to maximize the expected information to be gained from it. In this paper we show that the latter view is a special case of the former with an appropriate choice of the decision space and a reasonable constraint on the utility function. In particular, the Shannon concept of information is seen to play a more important role in experimental design than was hitherto thought possible.","title":"Expected Information as Expected Utility","id":38358448,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38358448_Expected_Information_as_Expected_Utility","names":["Jose M Bernardo","The Annals of Statistics"],"references":{"227444366":"Exceptional Paper--Probability Encoding in Decision Analysis","38367066":"On the Measure of Information Provided by an Experiment","38364511":"On the Inference and Decision Models of Statistics","38366767":"Application of a Measure of Information to the Design and Comparison of Regression Experiments","265681570":"The Elicitation of Personal Probabilities and Expectations","7190071":"Measure of the value of information"},"citedIn":{"289587521":"Multi-model Cross Pollination in Time","228312990":"Divergent Priors and Well Behaved Bayes Factors","46455489":"Estimating Subjective Probabilities","49943292":"Local proper scoring rules of order two","283856108":"Information and inaccuracy","222698318":"A Bayesian Predictive Approach to Model Selection.","24123770":"Optimal Prediction Pools","26804115":"Error decomposition and estimation of inherent optical properties","11066023":"Bayesian Model Assessment and Comparison Using Cross-Validation Predictive Densities","265000409":"Knowledge Elicitation via Extension of Fragmental Knowledge Pieces","2589236":"Bayesian Input Variable Selection Using Posterior Probabilities and Expected Utilities","244358788":"Optimal decision-oriented Bayesian design of experiments","235711512":"A Bayesian Approach for Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Queries","5799501":"Optimal Observation Times in Experimental Epidemic Processes","242786927":"Efficiency of Censored Reliability Studies","227725195":"Bayesian estimation of dynamic finite mixtures","257224014":"Análisis Bayesiano de los contrastes de hipótesis paramétricos","2550840":"An Expected Utility Approach to Influence Diagnostics","49608427":"Why hydrological predictions should be evaluated using information theory","270237243":"Discussion of Paper by D.V.
