{"abs":"Many real world design problems involve multiple, usually conflicting optimization criteria. Often, it is very difficult to weight the criteria exactly before alternatives are known. MultiObjective Evolutionary Algorithms based on the principle of Pareto optimality are designed to explore the complete set of nondominated solutions, which then allows the user to choose among many alternatives. However, although it is very difficult to exactly define the weighting of different optimization criteria, usually the user has some notion as to what range of weightings might be reasonable. In this paper, we present a novel, simple, and intuitive way to integrate the user\u0027s preference into the evolutionary algorithm by allowing to define linear maximum and minimum trade-off functions. On a number of test problems we show that the proposed algorithm efficiently guides the population towards the interesting region, allowing a faster convergence and a better coverage of this area of the P...","title":"Guidance in Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization","id":2811965,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2811965_Guidance_in_Evolutionary_Multi-Objective_Optimization","names":["Jurgen Branke","Thomas Kauler","Hartmut Schmeck","Advances in Engineering Software"],"references":{"220885642":"Genetic Algorithms with Sharing for Multimodalfunction Optimization.","2249323":"Evolutionary Algorithms for Multi-Criterion Optimization in Engineering Design","247442902":"Introduction To Algorithms","12473892":"Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms: Analyzing the State-of-the-Art","2333240":"Multiobjective Function Optimization Using Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms","236443691":"Some Experiments in Machine Learning Using Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithms","2813926":"Guiding Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithms Towards Interesting Regions","242919220":"Deb, K.: Multiobjective Optimization Using Nondominated Sorting in Genetic Algorithms.
