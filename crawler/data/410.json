{"abs":"this paper, we exploit the similarities between the Gibbs sampler and the SIS, bringing over the improvements for Gibbs sampling algorithms to the SIS setting for nonparametric Bayes problems. These improvements reduce the variance of the importance sampling weights, resulting in an improved sampler, and they help satisfy questions of Diaconis (personal communication) pertaining to convergence. Such an effort can see wide applications in many other problems related to dynamic systems where the SIS is useful (Berzuini et al. 1996; Liu and Chen 1997).","title":"Sequential Importance Sampling for Nonparametric Bayes Models: The Next Generation","id":2469117,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2469117_Sequential_Importance_Sampling_for_Nonparametric_Bayes_Models_The_Next_Generation","names":["Steven Maceachern","Merlise Clyde","Jun S Liu","Canadian Journal of Statistics"],"references":{"31102905":"Nonparametric Bayesian Bioassay Including Ordered Polytomous Response","243662369":"A semiparametric Bayesian model for randomised block designs","265681840":"Sequential Imputations and Bayesian Missing Data Problems","38357615":"Bayesian Nonparametric Estimation for Incomplete Data Via Successive Substitution Sampling","38357646":"Ferguson Distributions Via Polya Urn Schemes","256647430":"Spectral Analysis for Discrete Longitudinal Data","2796321":"Dynamic Conditional Independence Models And Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods","38357634":"A Bayesian Analysis of Some Non-Parametric Problems","38358436":"Empirical Bayes Estimation of a Binomial Parameter Via Mixtures of Dirichlet Processes","2741222":"Bayesian Density Estimation and Inference Using Mixtures","238684341":"Estimating Normal Means with a Dirichlet Process Prior","250955962":"Computations of Mixtures of Dirichlet Processes","38357862":"Antoniak, C.E.: Mixtures of Dirichlet Processes with Applications to Bayesian Nonparametric Problems.
