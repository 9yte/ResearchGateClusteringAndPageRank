{"abs":"Several Markov chain methods are available for sampling from a posterior distribution. Two important examples are the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis algorithm. In addition, several strategies are available for constructing hybrid algorithms. This paper outlines some of the basic methods and strategies and discusses some related theoretical and practical issues. On the theoretical side, results from the theory of general state space Markov chains can be used to obtain convergence rates, laws of large numbers and central limit theorems for estimates obtained from Markov chain methods. These theoretical results can be used to guide the construction of more efficient algorithms. For the practical use of Markov chain methods, standard simulation methodology provides several variance reduction techniques and also give guidance on the choice of sample size and allocation.","title":"Markov Chains for Exploring Posterior Distributions","id":38357609,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357609_Markov_Chains_for_Exploring_Posterior_Distributions","names":["Luke Tierney","The Annals of Statistics"],"references":{"229125032":"A Guide to Simulation","235014147":"Exploring Posterior Distributions Using Markov Chains","243765318":"Covariance Structure of the Gibbs Sampler with Applications to the Comparison of Estimators and Augmentation Schemes","224910629":"Sampling-Based Approaches to Calculate Marginal Densities","261593363":"Stochastic Simulation","258306977":"Finite Markov Chain","200105001":"Equation of State by Fast Computing Machines","254287149":"Generalized Linear Models With Random Effects; A Gibbs Sampling Approach","4895745":"Bayesian Inference in Econometric Models Using Monte Carlo Integration","220118677":"Optimization by Simulated Annealing","239432137":"Asymptotic Behavior of the Gibbs Sampler","246868729":"Monte Carlo Calculations of the Radial Distribution Functions for a Proton?Electron Plasma","221669734":"Equations of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines","38363225":"Practical Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
