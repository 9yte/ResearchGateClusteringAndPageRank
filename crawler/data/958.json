{"abs":"In this paper, we investigate limiting behavior of linear dynamic systems driven by random stochastic matrices. We introduce and study the new concepts of partial ergodicity and ℓ-approximation of a given chain of stochastic matrices. We show that partial ergodicity of a chain is invariant under ℓ-approximations. We also introduce an infinite flow graph of a random chain and use the connectivity components of this graph to characterize the ergodicity classes of a chain. Finally, we provide a result showing that, under certain conditions, the ergodicity classes of an independent random chain and its expected counterpart are the same.","title":"Approximation and Limiting Behavior of Random Models","id":224220772,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224220772_Approximation_and_Limiting_Behavior_of_Random_Models","names":["Behrouz Touri","Angelia Nedic"],"references":{"242443041":"Non-Negative Matrices and Markov Chains","3032810":"A Necessary and Sufficient Condition for Consensus Over Random Networks","224190377":"On Ergodicity, Infinite Flow, and Consensus in Random Models","3031499":"Coordination of Groups of Mobile Autonomous Agents Using Nearest Neighbor Rules","235129142":"Problems in Decentralized Decision Making and Computation","247261594":"Probability Theory and Examples","247261636":"Probability: Theory and Examples 2nd Ed","248126722":"Towards Consensus: Some Convergence Theorems on Repeated Averaging","37600772":"Problems in decentralized decision making and computation","267148160":"Non-negative matrices and Markov chains.
