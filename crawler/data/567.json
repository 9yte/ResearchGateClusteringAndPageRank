{"abs":"In statistical modeling of computer experiments sometimes prior information is available about the underlying function. For example, the physical system simulated by the computer code may be known to be monotone with respect to some or all inputs. We develop a Bayesian approach to Gaussian process modelling capable of incorporating monotonicity information for computer model emulation. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to sample from the posterior distribution of the process given the simulator output and monotonicity information. The performance of the proposed approach in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification is demonstrated in a number of simulated examples as well as a real queueing system application.","title":"Monotone Function Estimation for Computer Experiments","id":256606091,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256606091_Monotone_Function_Estimation_for_Computer_Experiments","names":["Shirin Golchi","Derek R.
