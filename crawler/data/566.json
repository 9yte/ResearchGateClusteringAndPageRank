{"abs":"The multi-objective covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (MO-CMA-ES) combines a mutation operator that adapts its search distribution to the underlying optimization problem with multi- criteria selection. Here, a generational and two steady-state selection schemes for the MO-CMA-ES are compared. Further, a recently pro- posed method for computationally ecient adaptation of the search dis- tribution is evaluated in the context of the MO-CMA-ES.","title":"Steady-State Selection and Efficient Covariance Matrix Update in the Multi-objective CMA-ES","id":221228555,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221228555_Steady-State_Selection_and_Efficient_Covariance_Matrix_Update_in_the_Multi-objective_CMA-ES","names":["Christian Igel","Thorsten Suttorp","Nikolaus Hansen"],"references":{"235709965":"Evolutionsstrategie.
