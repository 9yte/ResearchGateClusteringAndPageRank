{"abs":"We apply a recently proposed Bayesian model selection technique, known as stochastic model specification search, for characterising the nature of the trend in macroeconomic time series. We illustrate that the methodology can be quite successfully applied to discriminate between stochastic and deterministic trends. In particular, we formulate autoregressive models with stochastic trends components and decide on whether a specific feature of the series, i.e. the underlying level and/or the rate of drift, are fixed or evolutive.","title":"Marginal Likelihood From the Metropolis-Hastings Output","id":4744329,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4744329_Marginal_Likelihood_From_the_Metropolis-Hastings_Output","names":["Siddhartha Chib","Ivan Jeliazkov","Journal of the American Statistical Association"],"references":{"242503284":"The Calculation of Posterior Distributions by Data Augmentation: Rejoinder","236901854":"Understanding the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm","38357609":"Markov Chains for Exploring Posterior Distributions","239037117":"Computing Bayes Factors Using a Generalization of the Savage-Dickey Density Ratio","239655370":"Bayesian Model Choice: Asymptotics and Exact Calculations","224910629":"Sampling-Based Approaches to Calculate Marginal Densities","222446496":"Posterior simulation and Bayes factors in panel count data model","222672077":"Analysis of High Dimensional Multivariate Stochastic Volatility Models","242530111":"Bayesian Analysis of Binary and Polychotomous Response Data","4897990":"A Simple, Positive Semi-Definite, Heteroskedasticity: An Autocorrelation Consistent Covariance Matrix","243779339":"Analysis of Multivariate Probit Models","2599593":"MCMC Methods for Computing Bayes Factors: A Comparative Review","4895557":"The Sensitivity of an Empirical Model of Married Women\u0027s Hours of Work to Economic and Statistical Assumptions","2258770":"On MCMC Sampling in Hierarchical Longitudinal Models","2670104":"Reversible Jum Markov Chain Monte Carlo Computation and Bayesian Model Determination","243775157":"Simulating Ratios of Normalizing Constants via a Simple Identity: A Theoretical Exploration","38348636":"On Monte Carlo Methods for Estimating Ratios of Normalizing Constants","31403274":"Monte Carlo Sampling Methods Using Markov Chains and Their Application","247226277":"Prediction analyses for binary data","243768830":"Computing Bayes Factors by Combining Simulation and Asymptotic Approximations","243103300":"Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods for Computing Bayes Factors","243764509":"Marginal likelihood from the Gibbs output.
