{"abs":"First, the basic principles of adaptive quadrature are reviewed. Adaptive quadrature programs being recursive by nature, the choice of a good termination criterion is given particular attention. Two Matlab quadrature programs are presented. The first is an implementation of the well-known adaptive recursive Simpson rule; the second is new and is based on a four-point Gauss-Lobatto formula and two successive Kronrod extensions. Comparative test results are described and attention is drawn to serious deficiencies in the adaptive routines quad and quad8 provided by Matlab.","title":"Adaptive Quadrature—Revisited","id":226706221,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226706221_Adaptive_Quadrature-Revisited","names":["Walter Gander","Walter Gautschi","BIT"],"references":{"266497763":"Institut für Wissenschaftliches Rechnen","227299818":"Algorithm 36 SNIFF: Efficient self-tuning algorithm for numerical integration","242483471":"Handheld calculator evaluates integrals","234810933":"Numerical Analysis: an Introduction","239581788":"On writing an automatic integration algorithm","220431949":"Notes on the Adaptive Simpson Quadrature Routine"},"citedIn":{"224676196":"Per-user Throughput of Opportunistic Scheduling Scheme over Broadcast Fading Channels","263463860":"Mathematical modeling of cigarette smoke particles dynamics in high air change rate chambers like cars","256992083":"A neural network approach to the fuzzy transform","261236880":"Nystrom method analysis of three-dimensional rotationally symmetric reflectors and lenses","228594596":"Nonlinear collusion attacks on independent fingerprints for multimedia","223724371":"CXTFIT/Excel–A modular adaptable code for parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis for laboratory or field tracer experiments","261263765":"Numerical optimization of a TARA-like shielded parabolic reflector","4004154":"An ultra-fast shared path protection scheme - distributed partial information management, part II","222651726":"A two-dimensional dual-modality tomography technique for a radioactive waste separation process","269784863":"Extended Nonlinear Lifting-Line Method for Aerodynamic Modeling of Reconfigurable Aircraft","228992170":"WIDE-ANGLE NEAR AND FAR FIELD APPROXIMATIONS FOR SCALAR DIFFRACTION","259980147":"Approximate Solutions to Circle-to-Circle Solar Sail Orbit Transfer","228842157":"Option pricing formulae using Fourier transform: Theory and application","51542300":"Discrete fractional Fourier transform as a fast algorithm for evaluating the diffraction pattern of pulsed radiation","257251674":"Power series solution for falling head ponded infiltration with evaporation Water Resources Research Volume 43, Issue 3, March 2007, M.
