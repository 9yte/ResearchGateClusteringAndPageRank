{"abs":"Two recently released R packages for the approximation and the optimization of expensive-to-evaluate deterministic functions are presented. After a motivation of the DiceKriging and DiceOptim packages relying on an overview of existing needs and softwares in the field of Kriging for Computer Experiments, a self-contained mini-tutorial on Kriging-based approximation and optimization techniques is proposed. The functionalities of both packages are then detailed and demonstrated in two disctinct sections. In particular, the versatility of DiceKriging with respect to trend and noise specications, covariance parameter estimation, as well as conditional and unconditional simulations are illustrated on the basis of several reproducible numerical experiments. The implementation of sequential and parallel optimization strategies relying on the Expected Improvement criterion are then put to the fore on the occasion of DiceOptim\u0027s presentation. An appendix is finally dedicated to complementary mathematical and computational details.","title":"DiceKriging , DiceOptim : Two R Packages for the Analysis of Computer Experiments by Kriging-Based Metamodeling and Optimization","id":44842093,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44842093_DiceKriging_DiceOptim_Two_R_Packages_for_the_Analysis_of_Computer_Experiments_by_Kriging-Based_Metamodeling_and_Optimization","names":["Olivier Roustant","David Ginsbourger","Yves Deville","Journal of statistical software"],"references":{"5142988":"tgp: An R Package for Bayesian Nonstationary, Semiparametric Nonlinear Regression and Design by Treed Gaussian Process Models","29637635":"A Note on the Choice and the Estimation of Kriging Models for the Analysis of Computer Experiments","258442670":"Assessing the Value of Another Cycle in Surrogate-Based Optimization","228637097":"Optimization using surrogate models and partially converged computational fluid dynamics simulations","260278602":"Design and Modeling for Computer Experiments","235961497":"Software for Data Analysis: Programming with R","223564511":"Surrogate-based analysis and optimization","254042923":"Use of Kriging Models to Approximate Deterministic Computer Models","226501199":"Bayesian Approach to Global Optimization","5142913":"Introducing BACCO, an R Bundle for Bayesian Analysis of Computer Code Output","235324242":"Sensitivity Analysis","225513703":"Sequential kriging optimization using multiple-fidelity evaluations","265574083":"Design and analysis of computer experiments.
