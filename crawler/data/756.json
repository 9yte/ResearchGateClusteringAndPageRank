{"abs":"Computer models may have functional outputs. With no loss of generality, we as- sume that a single computer run is generating a function of time. For complex computer models, Bayarri et al. (2002) considers the time as a computer model associated input parameter, and uses the Gaussian Response Surface Approximation method (GaSP) with the Kronecker product correlation matrix in the augumented space. However, this approach is only applicable when there are only a few time points. In this pa- per, we consider the Bayesian Dynamic Linear Model West and Harrison (1997) as an alternative approach when there are many time points. Our method also allows the forecasting for the future.","title":"Bayesian Dynamic Linear Modelling for Complex Computer Models","id":255604425,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255604425_Bayesian_Dynamic_Linear_Modelling_for_Complex_Computer_Models","names":["Fei Liu","Liang Zhang","Mike West"],"references":{"2120071":"Default priors for Gaussian processes.
