{"abs":"Basic Scatter Search is a meta-heuristic approach based evolutionary method which yields promising outcomes for solving some of the combinatorial and nonlinear optimization problems. But due to the loss of population diversity, Standard Scatter Search techniques are often reported to have converged too early producing suboptimal solutions. Addressing this prob-lem we propose a variant of Scatter Search which controls the diversity dynamically through the generations and reduces the possibility of premature convergence. We denote this variant as Scatter Search with Adaptive Diversity Control (SS-ADC). This method performs better than Basic Scatter Search on ten and similar on twelve functions from a total of twenty three benchmark functions.","title":"SS-ADC: Scatter search with adaptive diversity control","id":259475518,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259475518_SS-ADC_Scatter_search_with_adaptive_diversity_control","names":["Sabirat Rubya","Samiul Monir","Mahfuza Sharmin","Mohammad S Alam","Mohammad Sohel Rahman"],"references":{"246121913":"Evolutionary Computation: Toward a New Philosophy of Machine Intelligence, IEEE Press, Piscatway, NJ","224579856":"Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm-Based Fuzzy Clustering of Categorical Attributes","224606513":"Bi-Objective Multipopulation Genetic Algorithm for Multimodal Function Optimization","220375137":"Predictive Models for the Breeder Genetic Algorithm I.
