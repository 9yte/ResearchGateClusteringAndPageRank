{"abs":"Over the past few years, the research on evolutionary algorithms has demonstrated their niche in solving multiobjective optimization problems, where the goal is to find a number of Pareto-optimal solutions in a single simulation run. Many studies have depicted different ways evolutionary algorithms can progress towards the Pareto-optimal set with a widely spread distribution of solutions. However, none of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) has a proof of convergence to the true Pareto-optimal solutions with a wide diversity among the solutions. In this paper, we discuss why a number of earlier MOEAs do not have such properties. Based on the concept of epsilon-dominance, new archiving strategies are proposed that overcome this fundamental problem and provably lead to MOEAs that have both the desired convergence and distribution properties. A number of modifications to the baseline algorithm are also suggested. The concept of epsilon-dominance introduced in this paper is practical and should make the proposed algorithms useful to researchers and practitioners alike.","title":"Combining Convergence and Diversity in Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization","id":11161759,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11161759_Combining_Convergence_and_Diversity_in_Evolutionary_Multi-Objective_Optimization","names":["Marco Laumanns","Lothar Thiele","Kalyanmoy Deb","Eckart Zitzler","Evolutionary Computation"],"references":{"2454246":"Evolutionary Search under Partially Ordered Fitness Sets","251193278":"ε-Optimality for bicriteria programs and its application to minimum cost flows","2629039":"Approximating the Nondominated Front Using the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy","3575291":"A Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization","242360316":"Genetic Algorithms in Search","242919220":"Deb, K.: Multiobjective Optimization Using Nondominated Sorting in Genetic Algorithms.
