{"abs":"We develop results on geometric ergodicity of Markov chains and apply these and other recent results in Markov chain theory to multi-dimensional Hastings and Metropolis algorithms. For those based on random walk candidate distributions, we find sufficient conditions for moments and for moment generating functions to converge at a geometric rate to a prescribed distribution . By phrasing the conditions in terms of the curvature of the densities we show that the results apply to all distributions with positive density of the form (x) \u003d h(x) exp(p(x)) where h and p are polynomials on IR d and p has an appropriate \"negativedefiniteness \" property. From these results we further develop central limit theorems for the Metropolis algorithm. Converse results, showing non-geometric convergence rates for chains where the rejection rate is not bounded from unity, are also given; these show that the negative-definiteness property is not redundant.
