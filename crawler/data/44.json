{"abs":"The numerical computation of a multivariate normal probability is often a difficult problem. This article describes a transformation that simplifies the problem and places it into a form that allows efficient calculation using standard numerical multiple integration algorithms. Test results are presented that compare implementations of two algorithms that use the transformation, with currently available software. KEY WORDS: multivariate normal distribution, Monte-Carlo, adaptive integration. 1 Introduction A problem that arises in many statistics applications is that of computing the multivariate normal distribution function F (a; b) \u003d 1 p jSigmaj(2) m Z b 1 a 1 Z b 2 a 2 ::: Z bm am e Gamma 1 2 ` t Sigma Gamma1 ` d`; where ` \u003d (`1 ; `2 ; :::; `m) t and Sigma is an m Theta m symmetric positive definite covariance matrix. If, for some i, a i is Gamma1 and b i is 1, an appropriate transformation allows the ith variable to be integrated explicitly and reduc...","title":"Numerical Computation Of Multivariate Normal Probabilities","id":2463953,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2463953_Numerical_Computation_Of_Multivariate_Normal_Probabilities","names":["Alan Genz","Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics"],"references":{"220492340":"Algorithm 698: DCUHRE: An adaptive multidimensional integration routine for a vector of integrals","246910535":"Algorithm AS 195: Multivariate Normal Probabilities with Error Bound","262326803":"Bivariate normal distributions","261646897":"A note on the bivariate normal distribution","236586737":"A Simple Approximation for Bivariate and Trivariate Normal Integrals","238864883":"On the Computation of the Bivariate Normal Integral"},"citedIn":{"282179793":"IMM-cubature quadrature Kalman filter for manoeuvring target tracking","278798495":"Addressing Constraint Robustness to Torque Errors in Task-Space Inverse Dynamics","267065326":"Hypermultitrees and sharp Bonferroni inequalities","224174422":"A State-Space Approach to Optimal Level-Crossing Prediction for Linear Gaussian Processes","225294688":"NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale Profiles Predict Developmental Outcomes in a Low-Risk Sample","271995961":"Estimating Simultaneous Confidence Intervals for Multiple Contrasts of Proportions by the Method of Variance Estimates Recovery","227780995":"Process fault prognosis using a fuzzy‐adaptive unscented Kalman predictor","285966619":"Dimension-Adaptive Sparse Grid Quadrature for Integrals with Boundary Singularities","237535801":"Alternative samplingmethods for estimating multivariate normal probabilities","271658019":"Multi-stage stochastic optimization: the distance between stochastic scenario processes","233213429":"A New Spatial Skew-Normal Random Field Model","11056315":"Detecting dose-response using contrasts: asymptotic power and sample size determination for binomial data.
