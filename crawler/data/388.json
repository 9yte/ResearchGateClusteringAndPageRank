{"abs":"Currently, stochastic optimization on the one hand and multi-objective optimization on the other hand are rich and well-established special fields of Operations Research. Much less developed, however, is their intersection: the analysis of decision problems involving multiple objectives and stochastically represented uncertainty simultaneously. This is amazing, since in economic and managerial applications, the features of multiple decision criteria and uncertainty are very frequently co-occurring. Part of the existing quantitative approaches to deal with problems of this class apply scalarization techniques in order to reduce a given stochastic multi-objective problem to a stochastic single-objective one. The present article gives an overview over a second strand of the recent literature, namely methods that preserve the multi-objective nature of the problem during the computational analysis. We survey publications assuming a risk-neutral decision maker, but also articles addressing the situation where the decision maker is risk-averse. In the second case, modern risk measures play a prominent role, and generalizations of stochastic orders from the univariate to the multivariate case have recently turned out as a promising methodological tool. Modeling questions as well as issues of computational solution are discussed.","title":"Stochastic multi-objective optimization: A survey on non-scalarizing methods","id":257516631,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257516631_Stochastic_multi-objective_optimization_A_survey_on_non-scalarizing_methods","names":["Walter J.
