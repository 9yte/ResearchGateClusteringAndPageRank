{"abs":"Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been extensively used as a means for performing global optimization in a simple yet reliable manner. However, in some realistic engineering design optimization domains the simple, classical implementation of a GA based on binary encoding and bit mutation and crossover is often inefficient and unable to reach the global optimum. In this paper we describe a GA for continuous design space optimization that uses new GA operators and strategies tailored to the structure and properties of engineering design domains. Empirical results in the domains of supersonic transport aircraft and supersonic missile inlets demonstrate that the newly formulated GA can be significantly better than the classical GA in both efficiency and reliability.","title":"A genetic algorithm for continuous design space search","id":222501755,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222501755_A_genetic_algorithm_for_continuous_design_space_search","names":["Khaled Rasheed","Haym Hirsh","Andrew Gelsey","Artificial Intelligence in Engineering"],"references":{"234784894":"Optimization Software Guide","2485857":"Genetic Algorithms for Real Parameter Optimization","34819700":"Inter-GEN : a hybrid approach to engineering design optimization /","23832325":"Structural optimization by multilevel composition","23864802":"The application of artificial intelligence technology to aeronautical system design","201976281":"Using Genetic Algorithms in Engineering Design Optimization with Non-Linear Constraints","246923491":"NAWC Inlet Design and Analysis (NIDA) Code","233001271":"Techniques for integrating qualitative reasoning and symbolic computation in engineering optimization.
