{"abs":"The idea of applying the cognitive radar principle to the radar observations of forests is presented. It implies an adaptive design of experiments (DOE) that will allow us to construct probabilistic surrogate models with a known level of uncertainty. These models reduce significantly the computational cost, which is mandatory when running many numerical simulations in various configurations.","title":"Cognitive kriging metamodels for forest characterization and target detection","id":269075872,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269075872_Cognitive_kriging_metamodels_for_forest_characterization_and_target_detection","names":["Panagiotis Piteros","Laetitia Thirion-Lefevre","RÃ©gis Guinvarc\u0027h","Marc Lambert"],"references":{"220052685":"Capabilities of a forest coherent scattering model applied to radiometry, interferometry, and polarimetry at P- and L-band","1960302":"An informational approach to the global optimization of expensive-to-evaluate functions","254437939":"Design and Analysis of Simulation Experiments","3321688":"Cognitive radar: A way of the future","247644014":"Interpolation of Spatial Data: Some Theory of Kriging","264888069":"Metamodel-based Adaptive Use of a Coherent Polarimetric Backscattering Simulator for the Characterization of Forested Areas at Low Frequencies","3203870":"A Forest Geometric Description of a Maritime Pine Forest Suitable for Discrete Microwave Models"},"citedIn":{},"index":873}
