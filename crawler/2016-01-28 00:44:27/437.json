{"abs":"Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is a new evolutionary optimization method inspired by biogeography. In this paper, BBO is extended to a multi-objective optimization, and a biogeography-based multi-objective optimization (BBMO) is introduced, which uses the cluster attribute of islands to naturally decompose the problem. The proposed algorithm makes use of nondominated sorting approach to improve the convergence ability efficiently. It also combines the crowding distance to guarantee the diversity of Pareto optimal solutions. We compare the BBMO with two representative state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective optimization methods, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and archive-based micro genetic algorithm (AMGA) in terms of three metrics. Simulation results indicate that in most cases, the proposed BBMO is able to find much better spread of solutions and converge faster to true Pareto optimal fronts than NSGA-II and AMGA do.","title":"Handling multiple objectives with biogeography-based optimization","id":257705598,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257705598_Handling_multiple_objectives_with_biogeography-based_optimization","names":["Hai-Ping Ma","Xie-Yong Ruan","Zhang-Xin Pan","International Journal of Automation and Computing"],"references":{"226082621":"A hybrid genetic algorithm for the traveling salesman problem with pickup and delivery","3418737":"Performance Assessment of Multiobjective Optimizers: An Analysis and Review","4201669":"MRMOGA: parallel evolutionary multiobjective optimization using multiple resolutions","220740897":"AMGA: An archive-based micro genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization","2362670":"A Survey of Parallel Genetic Algorithms","3418687":"A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II.
