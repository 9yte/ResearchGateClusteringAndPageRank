{"abs":"In this project a stochastic method for general purpose optimization and machine learning is described. The method is derived from basic information-theoretic principles and generalizes the popular Cross Entropy method. The effectiveness of the method as a tool for statistical modeling and Monte Carlo simulation is demonstrated with an application to the problems of density estimation and data modeling.","title":"Stochastic Methods for Optimization and Machine Learning","id":37618619,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37618619_Stochastic_Methods_for_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning","names":["Zdravko I.
