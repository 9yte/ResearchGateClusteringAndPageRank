{"abs":"The full Bayesian analysis of multinomial data using informative and flexible prior distributions has, in the past, been restricted by the technical problems involved in performing the numerical integrations required to obtain marginal densities for parameters and other functions thereof. In this paper it is shown that Gibbs sampling is suitable for obtaining accurate approximations to marginal densities for a large and flexible family of posterior distributionsâ€”the family. The method is illustrated with a three-way contingency table. Two alternative Monte Carlo strategies are also discussed.","title":"Calculation of marginal densities for parameters of multinomial distributions","id":226490433,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226490433_Calculation_of_marginal_densities_for_parameters_of_multinomial_distributions","names":["Jonathan J.
