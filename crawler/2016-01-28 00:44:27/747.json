{"abs":"The present paper introduces and discusses a stochastic finite element method. It can be used for the analysis of structural and mechanical systems whose geometrical and material properties have spatial random variability. The method utilizes a polynomial expansion of the numerical nonlinear structural operator (for which actual analytical form is unknown). The expansion is made according to a response-surface approximation in terms of spatial averages of the design variables. The polynomial form is then modified by suitable error factors, one for each geometrical or mechanical property. Each error factor is due to the deviations, of the single property, from its spatial average in the different finite elements. The method demands an accurate design of the experiments to be conducted in order to identify the model parameters. A numerical example has been worked out. In this numerical example, the stresses and the strains in a light-water reactor pressurized vessel are computed by a stochastic three-dimensional finite element nonlinear analy","title":"A Response Surface Approach for Reliability Analysis","id":245284547,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245284547_A_Response_Surface_Approach_for_Reliability_Analysis","names":["Lucia Faravelli","Journal of Engineering Mechanics"],"references":{"222310512":"Random fields and stochastic finite elements","233192359":"Impact Loading on Structures with Random Properties","223621152":"Methods of non-linear stochastic dynamics for the assessment of structural fragility","245137080":"Analysis of cladding residual stresses and their influence on the structural reliability of LWR pressure vessels","222035565":"Method of structural systems reliability","256421648":"Analysis of bridge proof-load data I: Model and statistical procedures"},"citedIn":{"249873124":"Reliability Evaluation in Seismic Design: A Response Surface Methodology","270988834":"Preliminary study of parameter uncertainty influence on Pressurized Water Reactor core design","251369213":"Stochastic Finite Elements Via Response Surface: Fatigue Crack Growth Problems","254042402":"Improved reliability approximate method combining Kriging and importance sampling","222934337":"An examination of methods for approximating implicit limit state functions from the viewpoint of statistical learning theory","223377242":"Reliability analysis of reinforced concrete grids with nonlinear material behavior","235742744":"Reliability of rigid piles subjected to lateral loads","260632976":"Accurate and efficient evaluation of failure probability for partial different equations with random input data","278198410":"Loader Boom Reliability Analysis with Artificial Neural Network Method","223269739":"Comparison of response surface and neural network with other methods for structural reliability analysis","37376543":"Response Surface Modelling of Monte-Carlo Fire Data","250696919":"Reliability as a measure of active control effectiveness","264168856":"An improved response surface method for reliability analysis of structures","265167329":"The improved FORM for Stochastic Dynamic Analysis","223107452":"Computational framework for long-term reliability analysis of RC structures","264152462":"ReliabIlity analysis of containment building subjected to earthquake load using response surface method","229573533":"Effects of structural uncertainties on TMD design: A reliability‚Äêbased approach","268418507":"Probability Analysis for the Damage of Gravity Dam","225726785":"Methods of nonlinear statistical dynamics: The state of the art and prospects","222340473":"Seismic structural reliability using different nonlinear dynamic response surface approximations","235301447":"Reliability analysis of concrete structures with neural networks and response surfaces","4239364":"Dynamic segmentation of small image windows for visual servoing","239924745":"APPLICATION OF APPROXIMATE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS IN STRUCTURAL RELIABILITY ANALYSIS","260145092":"Stochastic Finite Elements and Reliability - A state-of-the-art report","263376887":"Improved Response Surface Method for Time-Variant Reliability Analysis of Nonlinear Random Structures Under Non-Stationary Excitations: Special Issue in Memory of Professor J.
