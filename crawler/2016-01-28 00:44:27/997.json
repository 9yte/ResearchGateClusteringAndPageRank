{"abs":"We develop an efficient, Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification framework using a novel treed Gaussian process model. The tree is adaptively constructed using information conveyed by the observed data about the length scales of the underlying process. On each leaf of the tree, we utilize Bayesian Experimental Design techniques in order to learn a multi-output Gaussian process. The constructed surrogate can provide analytical point estimates, as well as error bars, for the statistics of interest. We numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested framework in identifying discontinuities, local features and unimportant dimensions in the solution of stochastic differential equations.","title":"Multi-output local Gaussian process regression: Applications to uncertainty quantification","id":256744276,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256744276_Multi-output_local_Gaussian_process_regression_Applications_to_uncertainty_quantification","names":["Ilias Bilionis","Nicholas Zabaras","Journal of Computational Physics"],"references":{"227196170":"Improved Multilevel Monte Carlo Convergence using the Milstein Scheme","222714823":"Handbook of Mathematical Function: With Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables","222581573":"Bayesian emulation of complex multi-output and dynamic computer models","226296703":"Modelling of Multiscale Structures in Flow Simulations for Petroleum Reservoirs","2609572":"Monte Carlo Implementation of Gaussian Process Models for Bayesian Regression and Classification","221619254":"Kernels for Multi--task Learning.","4772045":"Bayesian Calibration of Computer Models","261823251":"Practical Methods of Optimization by R.
