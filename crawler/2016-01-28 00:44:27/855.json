{"abs":"After stating the model and the design problem, we briefly present the results for regression design prior to the work of Kiefer and Wolfowitz. We then review the major results of Kiefer and Wolfowitz, particularly those on the theory of design, as well as the way the criterion has been extended to non-linear models. Finally, we discuss algorithms for constructing D-optimum designs.","title":"D-Optimality for Regression Designs: A Review","id":245829939,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245829939_D-Optimality_for_Regression_Designs_A_Review","names":["R.
