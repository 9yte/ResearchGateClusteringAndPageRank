{"abs":"Solving optimization problems with multiple objectives under uncertainty is generally a very difficult task. Evolutionary algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms, have shown to be effective in solving this type of complex problems. In this paper, we develop a simulation-based multi-objective genetic algorithm (SMOGA) procedure to solve the build-operate-transfer (BOT) network design problem with multiple objectives under demand uncertainty. The SMOGA procedure integrates stochastic simulation, a traffic assignment algorithm, a distance-based method, and a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve a multi-objective BOT network design problem formulated as a stochastic bi-level mathematical program. To demonstrate the feasibility of SMOGA procedure, we solve two mean-variance models for determining the optimal toll and capacity in a BOT roadway project subject to demand uncertainty. Using the inter-city expressway in the Pearl River Delta Region of South China as a case study, numerical results show that the SMOGA procedure is robust in generating ‘good’ non-dominated solutions with respect to a number of parameters used in the GA, and performs better than the weighted-sum method in terms of the quality of non-dominated solutions.","title":"A simulaton-based multi-objective genetic algorithm (SMOGA) for BOT network design problem","id":226825259,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226825259_A_simulaton-based_multi-objective_genetic_algorithm_SMOGA_for_BOT_network_design_problem","names":["Anthony Chen","K.
