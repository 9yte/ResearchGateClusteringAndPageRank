{"abs":"A Monte Carlo algorithm is presented that updates large clusters of spins simultaneously in systems at and near criticality. We demonstrate its efficiency in the two-dimensional O(n) σ models for n\u003d1 (Ising) and n\u003d2 (x-y) at their critical temperatures, and for n\u003d3 (Heisenberg) with correlation lengths around 10 and 20. On lattices up to 1282 no sign of critical slowing down is visible with autocorrelation times of 1-2 steps per spin for estimators of long-range quantities.","title":"Collective Monte Carlo Updating for Spin Systems","id":13250154,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13250154_Collective_Monte_Carlo_Updating_for_Spin_Systems","names":["Ulli Wolff","Physical Review Letters"],"references":{"222155071":"Vacuum tunneling in the four-dimensional Ising model","13251951":"Lattice field theory as a percolation process","200104872":"The Critical Properties of the Two-Dimensional XY Model","210269742":"Ordering, Metastability and Phase Transitions in Two-Dimensional Systems","13330658":"Generalization of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn-Swendsen-Wang representation and Monte Carlo algorithm.
