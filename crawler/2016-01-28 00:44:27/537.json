{"abs":"Two techniques of population control are currently used in the field of serial genetic algorithms: generational and steady state. Although they have been used somewhat interchangeably in the past, it has become apparent that the two techniques are actually quite different. In this paper, I study the behavior of each with regard to reproduction, and show that while each can be made similar with respect to the schema theorem, in practice their behavior is quite different.","title":"A Study of Reproduction in Generational and Steady State Genetic Algorithms","id":201976468,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/201976468_A_Study_of_Reproduction_in_Generational_and_Steady_State_Genetic_Algorithms","names":["Gilbert Syswerda"],"references":{},"citedIn":{"4250689":"Evolutionary Exploration of Generalized Julia Sets","3701819":"Trajectory generation for redundant manipulator using virus evolutionary genetic algorithm","220609824":"Evolutionary mutation testing","224227675":"Search-Based Procedural Generation of Maze-Like Levels","222381384":"Heterogeneous Computing and Parallel Genetic Algorithms","238005797":"Neurotransmitters in Emotional Model of A Vision-Based Partner Robot for Natural Communication with Human","4239435":"Illuminance measurement of a mobile robot based on computational intelligence","220160275":"Genetic Programming with Linear Representation: a Survey.","223345985":"Optimal allocation of elements in a linear multi-state sliding window system","221007165":"A comparative study of diversity in evolutionary algorithms","261353346":"Self-efficacy using fuzzy control for long-term communication in robot-assisted language learning","220216626":"Genetic algorithm and large neighbourhood search to solve the cell formation problem","4239444":"Teleoperation of a vision-based mobile robot under office automation floors","220741950":"Entropic and Real-Time Analysis of the Search with Panmictic, Structured, and Parallel Distributed Genetic Algorithms.","224349566":"Characterization of extremal epidemic networks with diffusion characters","226735533":"A study of canonical GAs for NSOPs","3604486":"The genetic planner: The automatic generation of plans for a mobile robot via genetic programming","220472592":"A new evolutionary approach to cutting stock problems with and without contiguity","242752077":"AN EMPHASIS ON HEURISTICS COMBINED WITH GA TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE SOLUTIONS: SOME METHODS USED TO SOLVE VRPs AND VRPTCs","226816433":"Embryogenesis of Artificial Landscapes","226878909":"Cooperative Coevolutionary Methods","2700307":"Generation Gaps Revisited","288189719":"Supervised learning based Multi-modal perception for robot partners using smart phones","226188614":"A Genetically Optimized Level Set Approach to Segmentation of Thyroid Ultrasound Images","18202966":"[Biochemical activity of 56 strains of \"B. cereus\" isolated from foods].","3676283":"Natural motion trajectory generation of biped locomotion robot using genetic algorithm through energy optimization","261460947":"Island-based differential evolution with panmictic migration for multi-core CPUs","4089977":"An application of graph based evolutionary algorithms for diversity preservation","223424797":"Optimal seriesâ€“parallel topology of multi-state system with two failure modes","254461799":"Asynchronous Master/Slave MOEAs and Heterogeneous Evaluation Costs","3810420":"Numerical and real time analysis of parallel distributed GAs with structured and panmictic populations","238660215":"A Method for Utilizing Diploid/Dominance in Genetic Search World Conference on Computational Intelligence (1994) IEEE (pp. 439-444)","222881031":"Virus-evolutionary genetic algorithm for a self-organizing manufacturing system","220948836":"Evolutionary Algorithms for Optimal Placement of Antennae in Radio Network Design.","226491692":"Multi-Objective Design of Neuro-Fuzzy Controllers for Robot Behavior Coordination","221399398":"Evolutionary Robot Vision and Fuzzy Evaluation for Natural Communication of Partner Robots.","234814888":"An unorthodox introduction to Memetic Algorithms","227603916":"Genetic algorithms and applications to finance","265747383":"PROFESSOR FLORIAN MIRCEA BOIAN AT HIS SIXTIES","2355270":"Evolution of Corridor Following Behavior in a Noisy World","254365519":"A Knowledge-Based Genetic Algorithm for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem","224058684":"Human-Friendly Networked Partner Robots toward Sophisticated Services for A Community","228615623":"Ephemeral resource constraints in optimization and their effects on evolutionary search","224472329":"A Statistical Study of The Differential Evolution based on Continuous Generation Model","23750912":"Optimal version sequencing in fault-tolerant programs","2460745":"Parameter Control in Evolutionary Algorithms","225665310":"An asymmetric multileveled symbiotic evolutionary algorithm for integrated FMS scheduling.
