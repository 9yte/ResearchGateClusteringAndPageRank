{"abs":"Most popular evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimisation maintain a population of solutions from which individuals are selected for reproduction. In this paper, we introduce a simpler evolution scheme for multiobjective problems, called the Pareto archived evolution strategy (PAES). We argue that PAES may represent the simplest possible non-trivial algorithm capable of generating diverse solutions in the Pareto optimal set. The algorithm is identified as being a (1+1) evolution strategy, using local search from a population of one but using a reference archive of previously found solutions in order to identify the approximate dominance ranking of the current and candidate solution vectors. PAES is intended as a good baseline approach, against which more involved methods may be compared, and may also serve well in some real-world applications when local search seems superior to or competitive with population-based methods. The performance of the new algorithm is compared with that of a MOEA based on the niched Pareto GA on a real world application from the telecommunications field. In addition, we include results from experiments carried out on a suite of four test functions, to demonstrate the algorithm\u0027s general capability","title":"The Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy: A New Baseline Algorithm for Pareto Multiobjective Optimisation","id":216300933,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216300933_The_Pareto_Archived_Evolution_Strategy_A_New_Baseline_Algorithm_for_Pareto_Multiobjective_Optimisation","names":["Joshua Damian Knowles","David Corne"],"references":{"239059359":"Finding Acceptable Solutions in the Pareto-Optimal Range using Multiobjective Genetic Algorithms","2465269":"An Overview of Evolutionary Algorithms in Multiobjective Optimization","238680472":"Finding K Shortest Loopless Paths in a Network","227443599":"Finding the K Shortest Loopless Paths in a Network","216301392":"Multiple Objective Optimization with Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithms","2713564":"Generating a Diversity of Good Solutions to a Practical Combinatorial Problem using Vectorized Simulated Annealing","225783245":"Selective breeding in a multiobjective genetic algorithm","2599118":"Tabu Search for Multiobjective Optimization: MOTS","238124234":"A Comparison of Heuristics for Telecommunications Traffic Routing","2333240":"Multiobjective Function Optimization Using Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms","3575291":"A Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization","30870312":"Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization and Machine Learning.
