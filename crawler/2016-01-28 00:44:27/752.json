{"abs":"Several optimization algorithms are evaluated for application in structural reliability, where the minimum distance from the origin to the limit-state surface in the standard normal space is required. The objective is to determine the suitability of the algorithms for application to linear and nonlinear finite element reliability problems. After a brief review, five methods are compared through four numerical examples. Comparison criteria are the generality, robustness, efficiency, and capacity of each method.","title":"Optimization algorithms for structural reliability","id":222945716,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222945716_Optimization_algorithms_for_structural_reliability","names":["Pei-Ling Liu","Armen Der Kiureghian","Structural Safety"],"references":{},"citedIn":{"238179382":"Closure to “Reliability Analysis of Single-Degree-of-Freedom Elastoplastic Systems.
