{"abs":"In some rare-event settings, exponentially twisted distributions perform very badly. One solution to this problem is to use mixture distributions. However, it is difficult to select a good mixture distribution for importance sampling. We here introduce a simple adaptive method for choosing good mixture importance sampling distributions.","title":"Fitting mixture importance sampling distributions via improved cross-entropy","id":261122380,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261122380_Fitting_mixture_importance_sampling_distributions_via_improved_cross-entropy","names":["Tim Brereton","Joshua C.
