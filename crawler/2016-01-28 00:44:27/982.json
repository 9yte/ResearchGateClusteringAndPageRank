{"abs":"Let U be a given function defined on R^d and \\pi(x) be a density function proportional to \\exp -U(x). The following diffusion X(t) is often used to sample from \\pi(x), dX(t)\u003d-\\nabla U(X(t)) dt+\\sqrt2 dW(t),\\qquad X(0)\u003dx_0. To accelerate the convergence, a family of diffusions with \\pi(x) as their common equilibrium is considered, dX(t)\u003d\\bigl(-\\nabla U(X(t))+C(X(t))\\bigr) dt+\\sqrt2 dW(t),\\qquad X(0)\u003dx_0. Let L_C be the corresponding infinitesimal generator. The spectral gap of L_C in L^2(\\pi) (\\lambda (C)), and the convergence exponent of X(t) to \\pi in variational norm (\\rho(C)), are used to describe the convergence rate, where \\lambda(C)\u003d Sup{real part of \\mu\\dvtx\\mu is in the spectrum of L_C, \\mu is not zero}, {-2.8cm}\\rho(C) \u003d Inf\\biggl{\\rho\\dvtx\\int | p(t,x,y) -\\pi(y)| dy \\le g(x) e^{\\rho t}\\biggr}.Roughly speaking, L_C is a perturbation of the self-adjoint L_0 by an antisymmetric operator C\\cdot\\nabla, where C is weighted divergence free. We prove that \\lambda (C)\\le \\lambda (0) and equality holds only in some rare situations. Furthermore, \\rho(C)\\le \\lambda (C) and equality holds for C\u003d0. In other words, adding an extra drift, C(x), accelerates convergence. Related problems are also discussed.","title":"Accelerating diffusions.
