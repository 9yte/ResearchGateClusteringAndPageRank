{"abs":"We introduce a simple evolution scheme for multiobjective optimization problems, called the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES). We argue that PAES may represent the simplest possible non-trivial algorithm capable of generating diverse solutions in the Pareto optimal set. The algorithm, in its simplest form, is a (1 + 1) evolution strategy, employing local search but using a reference archive of previously found solutions in order to identify the approximate dominance ranking of the current and candidate solution vectors. (1+1)-PAES is intended as a good baseline approach, against which more involved methods may be compared, and may also serve well in some real-world applications when local search seems superior to or competitive with population-based methods. We also introduce (1 + ) and ( + ) variants of PAES as good extensions to the basic algorithm. Six variants of PAES are compared with variants of the Niched Pareto GA and the Nondominated Sorting GA over a divers...","title":"Approximating the Nondominated Front Using the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy","id":2629039,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2629039_Approximating_the_Nondominated_Front_Using_the_Pareto_Archived_Evolution_Strategy","names":["Joshua Damian Knowles","David Corne","Evolutionary Computation"],"references":{"261690585":"Introduction to Probability and Statistics","220197855":"Quad Trees: A Data Structure for Retrieval on Composite Keys.","227443599":"Finding the K Shortest Loopless Paths in a Network","30869842":"Quad Trees : A Data Structure for Retrieval on Composite Keys","3575291":"A Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization","242919220":"Deb, K.: Multiobjective Optimization Using Nondominated Sorting in Genetic Algorithms.
