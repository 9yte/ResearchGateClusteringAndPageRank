{"abs":"We develop an asymptotic expansion technique for pricing timer options in stochastic volatility models when the effect of volatility of variance is small. Based on the pricing PDE, closed-form approximation formulas have been obtained. The approximation has an easy-to-understand Black–Scholes-like form and many other attractive properties. Numerical analysis shows that the approximation formulas are very fast and accurate, especially when the volatility of variance is not large.","title":"Closed-form approximation of perpetual timer option prices","id":264915564,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264915564_Closed-form_approximation_of_perpetual_timer_option_prices","names":["Minqiang Li","Fabio Mercurio","International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance"],"references":{"4768875":"Transition Densities for Interest Rate and Other Nonlinear Diffusions","227446763":"Quadratic-Variation-Based Dynamic Strategies","51466742":"Path integral approach to the pricing of timer options with the Duru-Kleinert time transformation","229811935":"Asymptotic Expansion","261702836":"Derivatives Pricing on Integrated Diffusion Processes: A General Perturbation Approach","23721444":"Option Valuation Under Stochastic Volatility","272308150":"Fast Hilbert Transform Algorithms for Pricing Discrete Timer Options Under Stochastic Volatility Models","227414115":"A damped diffusion framework for financial modeling and closed-form maximum likelihood estimation","228290901":"Pricing Timer Options","5217313":"A Closed-Form Solution for Options With Stochastic Volatility With Applications to Bond and Currency Options","264717385":"Analytic Approximation of Finite-Maturity Timer Option Prices","268617139":"Mathematical Methods for Foreign Exchange: A Financial Engineer’s Approach","228688311":"Pricing timer options under fast mean-reverting stochastic volatility","239060292":"A Second Course in Stochastic Processes.
