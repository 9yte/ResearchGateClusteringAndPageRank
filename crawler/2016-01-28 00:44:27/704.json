{"abs":"This paper addresses the problem of loading a finite capacity, stochastic (random) and dynamic multi-project system. The system is controlled by keeping a constant number of projects concurrently in the system. A new approach, based on the Cross-Entropy (CE) method, is proposed to determine optimal loading of the system. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the CE method performance and show new insights into its behavior in a noisy system. Particularly, we suggest a trade-off between the convergence time, the number of iterations and the noise level.","title":"Managing Stochastic, Finite Capacity, Multi-Project Systems through the Cross-Entropy Methodology","id":220461934,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220461934_Managing_Stochastic_Finite_Capacity_Multi-Project_Systems_through_the_Cross-Entropy_Methodology","names":["Izack Cohen","Boaz Golany","Avraham Shtub","Annals of Operations Research"],"references":{"222060700":"Expected time in system analysis of a single-machine multi-item processing center","252790544":"Critical Chain Project Management Improves Project Performance","223882108":"Multi-item batching heuristics for minimization of queueing delays","222680352":"Managing multi-project environments through constant work-in-process","200552273":"Factory Physics: The Foundations of Manufacturing Management","234826296":"Software Project Dynamics: An Integrated Approach","37621654":"The Cross-Entropy Method: A Unified Approach to Combinatorial Optimization, Monte-Carlo Simulation and Machine Learning","222737901":"Setup time reduction and competitive advantage in a closed manufacturing cell","2484042":"The Cross-Entropy Method for Combinatorial and Continuous Optimization","227445217":"Multi-Project Scheduling: Categorization of Heuristic Rules Performance","4943067":"A note on “Hierarchical models for multi-project planning and scheduling","49483458":"Network-based management systems : Pert/cpm","258950396":"Simulation Modeling and Analysis","222146894":"“Relevant Costs, Congestion and II Stochastity in Production Environments,”","227446746":"From Project to Process Management: An Empirically-Based Framework for Analyzing Product Development Time","223060094":"Hierarchical Models for Multi-Project Planning and Scheduling","4942749":"Setting Planned Lead Times for Multi-Operation Jobs","243671377":"“Performance of A Manufacturing Cell with Increased Product Mix,”","222335450":"An exploration of models that minimize leadtime through batching of arrived orders","222667928":"On the merits and pitfalls of critical chain scheduling"},"citedIn":{"228940071":"Cross-Entropy Method","220542498":"Performance measures for supporting project manager decisions","273618056":"On the benefits of Laplace samples in solving a rare event problem using cross-entropy method","50996224":"Handbook of Monte Carlo Methods","263359294":"Dynamic Task Sequencing of Product Development Process in a Multi-product Environment","225590911":"Projektportfolio- und Multiprojektplanung: Modellierung, prototypische Implementierung und Einsatz in der Finanzdienstleistungsbranche","275946239":"Optimization of Logistics: Theory \u0026 Practice","229570209":"A multi‐agent system for the decentralized resource‐constrained multi‐project scheduling problem","282477657":"Large thinned array design based on multi-objective cross entropy algorithm","220166413":"The Cross-Entropy Method for Policy Search in Decentralized POMDPs.","226218344":"A Tutorial on the Cross-Entropy Method","283867711":"The Markovian Multi-Criteria Multi-Project Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem","267755180":"Chapter 4.
