{"abs":"A new methodology has been developed for automated optimal design of two dimensional high speed inlets. A semi-empirical flow solver and an improved Genetic Algorithm are linked within an automated loop. The purpose of this process, is to maximize the total pressure recovery of the missile inlet : first of all, for one upstream flow condition, and secondly for an entire mission. This innovative design strategy allows great improvement of the original inlet design in a very short period of time. Succesful results are presented from optimizations of inlets designed and tested at the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (ITAM) in Novosibirsk, Russia. The significant improvements of the total pressure recovery, achieved by the Automated Optimization Loop, are verified using a full NavierStokes simulator. 3 Aerospatiale Missiles, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. y Professor, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.
