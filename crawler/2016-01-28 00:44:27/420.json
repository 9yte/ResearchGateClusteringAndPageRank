{"abs":"Beginning with an arbitrary set and a distance defined on it, we develop the notions of minimax and maximin distance sets (designs). These are intended for use in the selection-of-sites problem when the underlying surface is modeled by a prior distribution and observations are made without error. It is shown that such designs have quite general asymptotically optimum (and dual) characteristics under what are termed the G- and D-criteria. There are many examples given, dealing espeacially with the unit square and with k factors at two levels.","title":"Minimax and Maximin Distance Designs","id":222490346,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222490346_Minimax_and_Maximin_Distance_Designs","names":["M.E.
