{"abs":"Introduction The abundance of powerful workstations makes course-grained parallelization an obvious enhancement to many optimization techniques, including genetic algorithms [Gol89, DM97]. While initial modifications have been made to GADO (Genetic Algorithm for Design Optimization [Ras98, RHG97]), such changes have not been carefully analyzed for potential impacts on quality. More generally, parallelization has the potential to improve GA performance through the use of alternative models of computation. Parallelism can certainly reduce the total elapsed clock-time for a solution, but as a change in model of computation (either real or simulated) , it can change the number of simulator calls and even make new solutions achievable. The effects of parallelization on GADO were investigated during my summer internship at the Center for Computational Design. 2 Objectives Since a straightforward parallelized implementation already existed, my first tasks were to ana","title":"Applying Parallelism to Improve Genetic Algorithm-based Design Optimization","id":2680118,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2680118_Applying_Parallelism_to_Improve_Genetic_Algorithm-based_Design_Optimization","names":["Brian Davison"],"references":{"220381075":"Evolutionary Algorithms In Engineering Applications.","216545901":"Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning.
