{"abs":"Many densities can be factored into a product of a conditional density which is easy to sample directly and a marginal density known up to a normalizing constant. If it is possible to make a draw from the marginal, then a simple sequential sampling algorithm can be used to make a perfect draw from the joint target density. A more general alternative is to use a Metropolis-Hastings step on the marginal followed by a draw from the conditional distribution. We show that the resulting Markov chain, called a linchpin variable sampler, is reversible and that its convergence rate is the same as that of the subchain where the Metropolis-Hastings step is being performed. We also study the empirical properties of linchpin variable samplers in a number of examples when computational effort is accounted for. Finally, we consider implementation of linchpin variable samplers in the context of general hierarchical linear mixed models.","title":"Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Linchpin Variables","id":270277360,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270277360_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_with_Linchpin_Variables","names":["Felipe Acosta","Mark Huber","Galin L.
