{"abs":"Let $\\FF$ be a set of real-valued functions on a set $\\XX$ and let $S:\\FF \\to \\GG$ be an arbitrary mapping. We consider the problem of making inference about $S(f)$, with $f\\in\\FF$ unknown, from a finite set of pointwise evaluations of $f$. We are mainly interested in the problems of approximation and optimization. In this article, we make a brief review of results concerning average error bounds of Bayesian search methods that use a random process prior about $f$.","title":"Sequential search based on Kriging: convergence analysis of some algorithms","id":51956320,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51956320_Sequential_search_based_on_Kriging_convergence_analysis_of_some_algorithms","names":["Emmanuel Vazquez","Julien Bect"],"references":{"216301661":"Screening, Predicting, and Computer Experiments"},"citedIn":{"236737481":"Efficient Prediction Designs for Random Fields"},"index":935}
