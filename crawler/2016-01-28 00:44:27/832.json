{"abs":"We explore a new approach to shape recognition based on a virtually in nite family of binary features (\\queries\") of the image data, designed to accommodate prior in-formation about shape invariance and regularity. Each query corresponds to a spatial arrangement ofseveral local topographic codes (\\tags\") which are in themselves too primitive and common to be informative about shape. All the discriminating power derives from relative angles and distances among the tags. The important attributes of the queries are (i) a natural partial ordering corresponding to increasing structure and complexity � (ii) semi-invariance, meaning that most shapes of a given class will answer the same way totwo queries which are successive in the ordering � and (iii) stability, since the queries are not based on distinguished points and substructures. No classi er based on the full feature set can be evaluated and it is impossible to determine a priori which arrangements are informative. Our approach istoselect informative features and build tree classi ers at the same time by inductive learning. In e ect, each tree provides an approximation to the full posterior where the features","title":"Shape Quantization And Recognition With Randomized Trees.","id":220499641,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220499641_Shape_Quantization_And_Recognition_With_Randomized_Trees","names":["Yali Amit","Donald Geman","Neural Computation"],"references":{"3301682":"Handwritten digit recognition by neural networks with single-layer training","261662232":"Elements of Information Theory","239744010":"3D Object Recognition From Geometric Queries","2671722":"Error-Correcting Output Coding Corrects Bias and Variance","15483753":"Size and position invariance of neuronal response in monkey inferotemporal cortex","222029751":"Miyake, S.: Neocognitron: A New Algorithm for Pattern Recognition Tolerant of Deformations and Shifts in Position.
