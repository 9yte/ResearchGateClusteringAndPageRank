{"abs":"We describe the application of importance sampling to Monte-Carlo simulations of polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) in optical fibers. The method allows rare differential group delay (DGD) events to be simulated much more efficiently than with standard Monte-Carlo methods and, thus, it can be used to assess PMD-induced system outage probabilities at realistic bit-error rates. We demonstrate the technique by accurately calculating the tails of the DGD probability distribution with a relatively small number of Monte-Carlo trials.","title":"Importance sampling for polarization-mode dispersion","id":3290965,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3290965_Importance_sampling_for_polarization-mode_dispersion","names":["Gino Biondini","William L Kath","Curtis Menyuk","IEEE Photonics Technology Letters"],"references":{"3233840":"Quick Simulation: A Review of Importance Sampling Techniques in Communications Systems","238727640":"Robust Monte Carlo Methods for Light Transport Simulation","5782491":"Statistical characterization of fiber random birefringence","3237877":"Statistical theory of polarization dispersion in single mode fibers","260663584":"Random walks and random environments, vol. 2, random environments.
