{"abs":"The author presents a general analytical solution determining “the Occurrence probability of a sequence of events each following Poison Stochastic Process”. Generally, this probability is described under the form of an integral equation of order “ n ”. Where “ n ” is number of the elementary events in the examined sequence. As far as the author can tell, the solution is original. It will be of a great interest to a wide range of system reliability problems such as: sequential calculations, dominos effects, dynamics fault trees, Markov systems, priority AND gates, events trees, stochastic optimisation, acceleration techniques for Monte-Carlo simulation, …","title":"A GENERAL ANALYTICAL SOLUTION FOR THE OCCURRENCE PROBABILITY OF A SEQUENCE OF ORDERED EVENTS FOLLOWING A POISON STOCHASTIC PROCESS","id":283350545,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283350545_A_GENERAL_ANALYTICAL_SOLUTION_FOR_THE_OCCURRENCE_PROBABILITY_OF_A_SEQUENCE_OF_ORDERED_EVENTS_FOLLOWING_A_POISON_STOCHASTIC_PROCESS","names":["Mohamed Yehia Eid"],"references":{"222407090":"Analysis of sequential failure for assessment of reliability and safety of manufacturing systems","29603877":"Algebraic Expression of the Structure Function of a subclass of Dynamic Fault Trees","223244232":"Qualitative temporal analysis: Towards a full implementation of the Fault Tree Handbook","2630464":"Combining Various Solution Techniques for Dynamic Fault Tree Analysis of Computer Systems","200707517":"Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers for Rare Events","224093687":"Probabilistic Algebraic Analysis of Fault Trees With Priority Dynamic Gates and Repeated Events","222374030":"RADYBAN: A tool for reliability analysis of dynamic fault trees through conversion into dynamic Bayesian networks"},"citedIn":{},"index":270}
