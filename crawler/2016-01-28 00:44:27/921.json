{"abs":"I give a Metropolis variant of the lattice-gauge-theory overrelaxation algorithm which I had suggested previously, with the following properties: (i) It satisfies detailed balance exactly with respect to the Wilson lattice action; (ii) it incorporates a general overrelaxation parameter ..omega..; (iii) as the lattice spacing a approaches zero, the Metropolis acceptance approaches unity; and (iv) in the approximation that each link is effectively coupled to an average staple, the microcanonical (..omega.. \u003d 2) limit of the algorithm reduces to the lattice Metropolis algorithm of Creutz and Brown and Woch.","title":"Metropolis overrelaxation for lattice gauge theory for general relaxation parameter","id":13330584,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13330584_Metropolis_overrelaxation_for_lattice_gauge_theory_for_general_relaxation_parameter","names":["SL Adler","Physical review D: Particles and fields"],"references":{"13254442":"Overrelaxed heat-bath and Metropolis algorithms for accelerating pure gauge Monte Carlo calculations","13331498":"Overrelaxation and Monte Carlo simulation","13255042":"Adler’s overrelaxation algorithm for Goldstone bosons","235539143":"Over-relaxation method for the Monte Carlo evaluation of the partition function for multiquadratic actions","13330005":"Overrelaxation algorithms for lattice field theories","13251892":"Stochastic algorithm corresponding to a general linear iterative process"},"citedIn":{"13283242":"Dynamical critical behavior of the three-dimensional Heisenberg model","13249874":"Study of an Overrelaxation Method for Gauge Theories","13277506":"Multigrid Monte Carlo method.
