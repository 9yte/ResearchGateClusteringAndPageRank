{"abs":"A renormalization-group approach is used to investigate phase transitions in fully frustrated XY models on a square and a triangular lattice. The existence of long-range order associated with the discrete symmetry of the system is demonstrated. It is argued that there exists one transition which is a combination of a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like one for spins and an Ising-like one for chirality. In particular a nonuniversal jump in the helicity modulus is predicted. Dilute randomness is also considered and shown to be irrelevant to the critical behavior.","title":"Critical behavior of pure and diluted XY models with uniform frustrations","id":13351104,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13351104_Critical_behavior_of_pure_and_diluted_XY_models_with_uniform_frustrations","names":["MOO YOUNG CHOI","David Stroud","Physical review.
