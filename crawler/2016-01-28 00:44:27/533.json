{"abs":"Genetic algorithms are founded upon the principle of evolution, i.e., survival of the fittest. Hence evolution programming techniques, based on genetic algorithms, are applicable to many hard optimization problems, such as optimization of functions with linear and nonlinear constraints, the traveling salesman problem, and problems of scheduling, partitioning, and control. The importance of these techniques is still growing, since evolution programs are parallel in nature, and parallelism is one of the most promising directions in computer science. The book is self-contained and the only prerequisite is basic undergraduate mathematics. This third edition has been substantially revised and extended by three new chapters and by additional appendices containing working material to cover recent developments and a change in the perception of evolutionary computation.","title":"Genetic + Data Structures \u003d Evolution Programs","id":30873058,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30873058_Genetic_Data_Structures_Evolution_Programs","names":["Zbigniew Michalewicz"],"references":{"2683816":"Implementing Type Classes","225213579":"Subtyping with singleton types","38413223":"Compiling Polymorphism Using Intensional Type Analysis","2448490":"Typed Closure Conversion"},"citedIn":{},"index":533}
