For de niteness and simplicity of exposition, we suppose that p( k jk) is a density with respect to n k -dimensional Lebesgue measure, and that there are no other parameters, so that where there are parameters common to all models these are subsumed into each k 2 R . Additional parameters, perhaps in additional layers of a hierarchy, are easily dealt with. Note that in this chapter, all probability distributions are proper. The joint posterior p(k; k jY ) \u003d p(k)p( k jk)p(Y jk; k ) 2K )p( 0 jk )p(Y jk 0 )d can always be factorised as p(k; k jY ) \u003d p(kjY )p( k jk; Y ); that is as the product of posterior model probabilities and model-speci c parameter posteriors.
