{"abs":"Given a function depending both on decision parameters and nuisance variables, we consider the issue of estimating and quantifying uncertainty on profile optima and/or optimal points as functions of the nuisance variables. The proposed methods base on interpolations of the objective function constructed from a finite set of evaluations. Here the functions of interest are reconstructed relying on a kriging model, but also using Gaussian field conditional simulations, that allow a quantification of uncertainties in the Bayesian framework. Besides, we elaborate a variant of the Expected Improvement criterion, that proves efficient for adaptively learning the set of profile optima and optimizers. The results are illustrated on a toy example and through a physics case study on the optimal packing of polydisperse frictionless spheres.","title":"Bayesian Adaptive Reconstruction of Profile Optima and Optimizers","id":278619330,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278619330_Bayesian_Adaptive_Reconstruction_of_Profile_Optima_and_Optimizers","names":["David Ginsbourger","Jean Baccou","Cl√©ment Chevalier","Frederic Perales","Nicolas Garland","Yann Monerie"],"references":{"230837892":"The Intrinsic Random Functions and Their Applications","4784065":"The Correct Kriging Variance Estimated by Bootstrapping","267109921":"Theory of Random Sets","242358078":"The Elements Of Statistical Learning","267437693":"Geostatistic: Modeling Spatial Uncertainty","281015536":"Fast uncertainty reduction strategies relying on Gaussian process models","226501199":"Bayesian Approach to Global Optimization","280697460":"Packing of Compressible Granular Materials","247646420":"Statistics for Spatial Data, Rev.
