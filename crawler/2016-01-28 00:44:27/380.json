{"abs":"Several Markov chain-based methods are available for sampling from a posterior distribution. Two important examples are the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis algorithm. In addition, several strategies are available for constructing hybrid algorithms. This paper outlines some of the strategies that are available, and discusses some theoretical and practical issues in the use of these strategies. In addition, some preliminary efforts to use Markov chains to control dynamic graphics for exploring higher-dimensional posterior distributions are outlined.","title":"Exploring Posterior Distributions Using Markov Chains","id":235014147,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235014147_Exploring_Posterior_Distributions_Using_Markov_Chains","names":["Luke Tierney"],"references":{"254287149":"Generalized Linear Models With Random Effects; A Gibbs Sampling Approach","246868205":"Monte Carlo sampling using Markov chains and their applications","220182914":"Geman, D.: Stochastic relaxation, Gibbs distribution, and the Bayesian restoration of images.
