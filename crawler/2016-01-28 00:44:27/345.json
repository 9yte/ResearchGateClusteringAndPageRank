{"abs":"A traditional way to design a binary response experiment is to design the experiment to be most efficient for a best guess of the parameter values. A design which is optimal for a best guess however may not be efficient for parameter values close to that best guess. We propose designs which formally account for the prior uncertainty in the parameter values. A design for a situation where the best guess has substantial uncertainty attached to itis very different from a design for a situation where approximate values of the parameters are known. We derive a general theory for concave design critria for non-linear models and then apply the theory to logistic regression. Designs found by numerical optimization are examined for a range of prior distributions and a range of criteria. The theoretical results are used to verify that the designs are indeed optimal.","title":"Optimal Bayesian design applied to logistic regression","id":223350547,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223350547_Optimal_Bayesian_design_applied_to_logistic_regression","names":["Kathryn Chaloner","Kinley Larntz","Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference"],"references":{"243082734":"Optimal Allocation for Bayesian Inference About an Odds Ratio","246138031":"Experimental Design for Binary Data","31403272":"Optimal Bayesian Sequential Estimation of the Median Effective Dose","31205620":"An Extension of the General Equivalence Theorem to Nonlinear Models","38359073":"Optimal Bayesian Experimental Design for Linear Models","17225662":"Planning a Quantal Assay of Potency","243048869":"Stochastic Approximation Methods and Their Use in Bioassay and Phase I Clinical Trials","254331971":"Aspects of Optimal Design in Dynamic Systems","266256515":"Problems and approaches in design of experiments for estimation and testing in non-linear models","222860647":"On d-optimal designs for binary data"},"citedIn":{"263613366":"A Semiparametric Sequential Algorithm for Estimation of Dose–Response Curve","238879800":"Fast Computation of Designs Robust to Parameter Uncertainty for Nonlinear Settings","264870863":"Bayesian Two Stage Design Under Model Uncertainty","239284293":"An overview of the use of generalized linear models in response surface methodology","227688856":"Parameter Neutral Optimum Design for Non‐linear Models","20914484":"Efficient Design for Estimation of Median Lethal Dose and Quantal Dose- Response Curves","251598066":"A New Robust Design Strategy for Sigmoidal Models Based on Model Nesting","271944742":"A D-Optimal Design for Estimation of Parameters of an Exponential-Linear Growth Curve of Nanostructures","45851823":"Monotonic convergence of a general algorithm for computing optimal designs.
