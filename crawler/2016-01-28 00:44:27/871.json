{"abs":"The idea of applying the cognitive radar principle to the forest characterization is presented. It implies an adaptive design of experiments (DOE) that will allow us to construct approximate models. These models reduce the computational cost, which is mandatory when running many numerical simulations in various configurations.","title":"Cognitive radar applied to forest and kriging-based metamodel","id":281353475,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281353475_Cognitive_radar_applied_to_forest_and_kriging-based_metamodel","names":["Panagiotis Piteros","Laetitia Thirion-Lefevre","RÃ©gis Guinvarc\u0027h","Marc Lambert"],"references":{"220052685":"Capabilities of a forest coherent scattering model applied to radiometry, interferometry, and polarimetry at P- and L-band","276275733":"Design and Analysis of Simulation Experiments","1960302":"An informational approach to the global optimization of expensive-to-evaluate functions","3321688":"Cognitive radar: A way of the future","264888069":"Metamodel-based Adaptive Use of a Coherent Polarimetric Backscattering Simulator for the Characterization of Forested Areas at Low Frequencies","3203870":"A Forest Geometric Description of a Maritime Pine Forest Suitable for Discrete Microwave Models"},"citedIn":{},"index":871}
