{"abs":"This paper describes two performance measures for measuring an EMO (evolutionary multiobjective optimization) algorithm\u0027s ability to track a time-varying Pareto-front in a dynamic environment. These measures are evaluated using a dynamic multiobjective test function and a dynamic multiobjective PSO, maximinPSOD , which is capable of handling dynamic multiobjective optimization problems. maximinPSOD is an extension from a previously proposed multiobjective PSO, maximinPSO . Our results suggest that these performance measures can be used to provide useful information about how well a dynamic EMO algorithm performs in tracking a time-varying Pareto-front. The results also show that maximinPSOD can be made self-adaptive, tracking effectively the dynamically changing Pareto-front.","title":"On performance metrics and particle swarm methods for dynamic multiobjective optimization problems","id":4307848,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4307848_On_performance_metrics_and_particle_swarm_methods_for_dynamic_multiobjective_optimization_problems","names":["Xiaodong Li","Juergen Branke","Michael Kirley"],"references":{"2368740":"Dynamic Pareto Optimum GA against the changing environments","220286112":"Solving Multiobjective Optimization Problems Using an Artificial Immune System","216300934":"On metrics for comparing non-dominated sets","3949342":"MOPSO: A proposal for multiple objective particle swarm optimization","220693604":"Evolutionary Optimization in Dynamic Environments","3418737":"Performance Assessment of Multiobjective Optimizers: An Analysis and Review","235709769":"Evaluating the quality of approximation to the non-dominated set","3418802":"Dynamic Multiobjective Optimization Problems: Test Cases, Approximations, and Applications","226006558":"Dynamic Multiobjective Optimization Problems: Test Cases, Approximation, and Applications","220867683":"Constructing Dynamic Optimization Test Problems Using the Multi-objective Optimization Concept","235917123":"Swarm Intelligence","221228544":"The Maximin Fitness Function; Multi-objective City and Regional Planning","266476598":"Multi-Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms.
