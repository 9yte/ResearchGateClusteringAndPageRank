{"abs":"Many, if not most, optimization problems have multiple objectives. Historically, multiple objectives (i.e., attributes or criteria) have been combined ad hoc to form a scalar objective function, usually through a linear combination (weighted sum) of the multiple attributes, or by turning objectives into constraints. The most recent development in the field of decision analysis has yielded a rigorous technique for combining attributes multiplicatively (thereby incorporating nonlinearity), and for handling uncertainty in the attribute values. But MultiAttribute Utility Analysis (MAUA) provides only a mapping from a vector-valued objective function to a scalar-valued function, and does not address the difficulty of searching large problem spaces. Genetic algorithms (GAs), on the other hand, are well suited to searching intractably large, poorly understood problem spaces, but have mostly been used to optimize a single objective. The direct combination of MAUA and GAs is a logical next step...","title":"Multiobjective Optimization Using The Niche Pareto Genetic Algorithm","id":2763393,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2763393_Multiobjective_Optimization_Using_The_Niche_Pareto_Genetic_Algorithm","names":["Jeffrey Horn","Nicholas Nafpliotis","David E.
