{"abs":"Thermal–Hydraulic (T–H) passive safety systems are potentially more reliable than active systems, and for this reason are expected to improve the safety of nuclear power plants.However, uncertainties are present in the operation and modeling of a T–H passive system and the system may find itself unable to accomplish its function. For the analysis of the system functional failures, a mechanistic code is used and the probability of failure is estimated based on a Monte Carlo (MC) sample of code runs which propagate the uncertainties in the model and numerical values of its parameters/variables.Within this framework, sensitivity analysis aims at determining the contribution of the individual uncertain parameters (i.e., the inputs to the mechanistic code) to (i) the uncertainty in the outputs of the T–H model code and (ii) the probability of functional failure of the passive system. The analysis requires multiple (e.g., many hundreds or thousands) evaluations of the code for different combinations of system inputs: this makes the associated computational effort prohibitive in those practical cases in which the computer code requires several hours to run a single simulation.To tackle the computational issue, in this work the use of the Subset Simulation (SS) and Line Sampling (LS) methods is investigated. The methods are tested on two case studies: the first one is based on the well-known Ishigami function [1]; the second one involves the natural convection cooling in a Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) after a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) [2].","title":"Monte Carlo Simulation-based Sensitivity Analysis of the model of a Thermal-Hydraulic Passive System","id":251621820,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251621820_Monte_Carlo_Simulation-based_Sensitivity_Analysis_of_the_model_of_a_Thermal-Hydraulic_Passive_System","names":["Enrico Zio","Nicola Pedroni","Reliability Engineering [?] System Safety"],"references":{"223425872":"Passive system reliability analysis using the APSRA methodology","247487939":"Sensitivity analysis for non linear mathematical model","245195032":"Evaluation of the dependencies related to passive system failure","257391583":"Alternative representations of epistemic uncertainty","289141043":"Failure mode and effect analysis application for the safety and reliability analysis of a thermal-hydraulic passive system","26512669":"Reliability Assessment of 2400Ã¢Â€Â‰MWth Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor Natural Circulation Decay Heat Removal in Pressurized Situations","229913278":"Moment independent and variance‐based sensitivity analysis with correlations: An application to the stability of a chemical reactor","229384999":"A two-stage Subset Simulation-based approach for calculating the reliability of inelastic structural systems subjected to Gaussian random excitations","245195025":"Passive system reliability in the nuclear power plants (NPPs) using statistical modeling","6740457":"Measuring Uncertainty Importance: Investigation and Comparison of Alternative Approaches","222983493":"Reliability and Sensitivity Analysis of Transonic Flutter Using Improved Line Sampling Technique","236508426":"Reliability Evaluation of Passive Systems Through Functional Reliability Assessment","239348049":"An optimized Line Sampling method for the estimation of the failure probability of nuclear passive systems","223101396":"Incorporating reliability analysis into the design of passive cooling systems with an application to a gas-cooled reactor","264177701":"Efficient Monte Carlo simulation procedures in structural uncertainty and reliability analysis - recent advances","222401500":"Building confidence in the reliability assessment of thermal-hydraulic passive systems","245078917":"Importance Measures in Global Sensitivity Analysis of Nonlinear Models","222881387":"Thermal–hydraulic passive system reliability-based design approach","222885227":"Quantitative functional failure analysis of a thermal–hydraulic passive system by means of bootstrapped Artificial Neural Networks","264961263":"Sensitivity Analysis in Practice: A Guide to Assessing Scientific Models.
