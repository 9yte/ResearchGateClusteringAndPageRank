{"abs":"A safe control of genetic evolution consists inpreventing past errors of evolution from beingrepeated. This could be done by keepingtrack of the history of evolution, but maintainingand exploiting the complete historyis intractable.This paper investigates the use of machinelearning (ML), in order to extract manageableinformation from this history. More precisely,induction from examples of past trialsand errors provides rules discriminating errorsfrom successful trials. Such rules...","title":"An Advanced Evolution Should Not Repeat its Past Errors.","id":221345340,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345340_An_Advanced_Evolution_Should_Not_Repeat_its_Past_Errors","names":["Caroline Ravise","Mich√®le Sebag"],"references":{"2447173":"Inserting Introns Improves Genetic Algorithm Success Rate: Taking a Cue from Biology.","201976495":"Adapting Operator Probabilities in Genetic Algorithm","2754050":"Adapting Crossover in a Genetic Algorithm","3114631":"Grefenstette, J.J.: Optimization of control parameters for genetic algorithms.
