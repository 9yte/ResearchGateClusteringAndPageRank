{"abs":"A Markov chain is geometrically ergodic if it converges to its in- variant distribution at a geometric rate in total variation norm. We study geo- metric ergodicity of deterministic and random scan versions of the two-variable Gibbs sampler. We give a sufficient condition which simultaneously guarantees both versions are geometrically ergodic. We also develop a method for simul- taneously establishing that both versions are subgeometrically ergodic. These general results allow us to characterize the convergence rate of two-variable Gibbs samplers in a particular family of discrete bivariate distributions.","title":"On the Geometric Ergodicity of Two-Variable Gibbs Samplers","id":227716616,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227716616_On_the_Geometric_Ergodicity_of_Two-Variable_Gibbs_Samplers","names":["Aixin Tan","Galin L.
