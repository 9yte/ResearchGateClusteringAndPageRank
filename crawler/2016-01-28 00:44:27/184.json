{"abs":"We propose a conjugate and conditional conjugate Bayesian analysis of models of marginal independence with a bi-directed graph representation. We work with Markov equivalent directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) obtained using the same vertex set with the addition of some latent vertices when required. The DAG equivalent model is characterised by a minimal set of marginal and conditional probability parameters. This allows us to use compatible prior distributions based on products of Dirichlet distributions. For models with DAG representation on the same vertex set, the posterior distribution and the marginal likelihood is analytically available, while for the remaining ones a data augmentation scheme introducing additional latent variables is required. For the latter, we estimate the marginal likelihood using Chibâ€™s (1995) estimator. Additional implementation details including identifiability of such models is discussed. For all models, we also provide methodology for the computation of the posterior distributions of the marginal log-linear parameters based on a simple transformation of the simulated values of the probability parameters. We illustrate our method using a popular 4-way dataset.","title":"Conjugate and Conditional Conjugate Bayesian Analysis of Discrete Graphical Models of Marginal Independence","id":254440969,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254440969_Conjugate_and_Conditional_Conjugate_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Discrete_Graphical_Models_of_Marginal_Independence","names":["Ioannis Ntzoufras","Claudia Tarantola","Computational Statistics \u0026 Data Analysis"],"references":{"5182222":"On applications of marginal models for categorical data","220319840":"The Hidden Life of Latent Variables: Bayesian Learning with Mixed Graph Models","261418449":"Graphical methods for inequality constraints in marginalized DAGs","221404728":"Learning Bayesian Networks: The Combination of Knowledge and Statistical Data","2321640":"Dealing With Label-Switching in Mixture Models","234054520":"On the Testable Implications of Causal Models with Hidden Variables","1760661":"Wishart distributions for decomposable graphs","228091991":"Inequality Constraints in Causal Models with Hidden Variables","220320689":"Factorial Mixture of Gaussians and the Marginal Independence Model.","243081582":"A Statistical Paradox","2799161":"When Can Association Graphs Admit A Causal Interpretation?","51940814":"Log-mean linear models for binary data","2515569":"Optimal Predictive Model Selection","2545265":"Compatible Prior Distributions for DAG models","46541214":"Parameterizations and Fitting of Bi-directed Graph Models to Categorical Data","243764509":"Marginal likelihood from the Gibbs output.
