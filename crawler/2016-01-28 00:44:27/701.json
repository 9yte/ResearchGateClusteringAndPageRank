{"abs":"This paper discusses how preference information of the deci- sion maker can in general be integrated into multiobjective search. The main idea is to first define the optimization goal in terms of a binary per- formance measure (indicator) and then to directly use this measure in the selection process. To this end, we propose a general indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) that can be combined with arbitrary in- dicators. In contrast to existing algorithms, IBEA can be adapted to the preferences of the user and moreover does not require any additional diversity preservation mechanism such as fitness sharing to be used. It is shown on several continuous and discrete benchmark problems that IBEA can substantially improve on the results generated by two popu- lar algorithms, namely NSGA-II and SPEA2, with respect to different performance measures.","title":"Indicator-Based Selection in Multiobjective Search","id":216457303,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216457303_Indicator-Based_Selection_in_Multiobjective_Search","names":["Eckart Zitzler","Simon Künzli"],"references":{"216300934":"On metrics for comparing non-dominated sets","3949503":"Scalable multi-objective optimization test problems","3418736":"Thierens, D.: The balance between proximity and diversity in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.
