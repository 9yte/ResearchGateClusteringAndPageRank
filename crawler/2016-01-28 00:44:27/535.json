{"abs":"Genetic algorithm based optimizers have to balance ex-tensive exploration of solution spaces to find good so-lutions with convergence to generate solutions quickly. Many optimizers use a two phase approach where the first phase explores the solution space and the second converges on a set of potential regions. This paper de-scribes a meta-level algorithm (GA ITER) that itera-tively applies a GA based optimizer with a bias towards either exploration or convergence. The optimizer is ex-ecuted with a very small number of evaluations which leads to fast generation of solutions. The iterative ap-proach of GA ITER has been shown to lead to fast gen-eration of good solutions. Experiments in problems from two real-world domains have shown that GA ITER can improve the performance of an existing GA without compromising the quality of the solution.","title":"Exploration or Convergence?
