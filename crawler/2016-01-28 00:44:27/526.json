{"abs":"This paper presents the formulation of a time-dependent seismic fragility format for bridges, as well as new insights into the potential effects of aging and deterioration on seismic vulnerability traditionally neglected in fragility modeling, including joint impacts of multiple component deterioration not investigated to date. The study evaluates the impact of lifetime exposure to chlorides from deicing salts on the seismic performance of multispan continuous highway bridges, considering corrosion of reinforced concrete columns and steel bridge bearings. The components\u0027 degradation and their influence on seismic response are illustrated through three-dimensional nonlinear dynamic analysis. A full probabilistic analysis accounting for variation in bridge, ground motion, and corrosion parameters is conducted to develop time-dependent seismic fragility curves. These fragility curves indicate the evolving potential for component and system damage under seismic loading considering time-dependent corrosion-induced deterioration. The results indicate that while corrosion may actually decrease the seismic vulnerability of some components, most critical components suffer an increase in vulnerability. Quadratic models depicting the change in lognormal seismic fragility parameters are proposed to capture the time-dependent effect of aging on the fragility of the bridge system. Overall, the seismic vulnerability significantly increases throughout the lifetime of the representative bridge geometry, with a 32% shift in the median value of complete damage fragility near the end of the bridge\u0027s life.","title":"Aging Considerations in the Development of Time-Dependent Seismic Fragility Curves","id":228373395,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228373395_Aging_Considerations_in_the_Development_of_Time-Dependent_Seismic_Fragility_Curves","names":["Jayadipta Ghosh","S M Asce","Jamie Ellen Padgett","A M Asce","Journal of Structural Engineering"],"references":{"27524258":"Analytical Fragility Curves for Highway Bridges in Moderate Seismic Zones","222431232":"Improved seismic fragility modeling from empirical data","27539751":"Corrosion of steel bridge Girder anchor bolts","245304412":"Condition Prediction of Deteriorating Concrete Bridges Using Bayesian Updating","227956113":"Life‐Cycle Performance of RC Bridges: Probabilistic Approach","245302486":"Capacity Loss Due to Corrosion in Steel-Girder Bridges","241402542":"Analytical Seismic Fragility Curves for Typical Bridges in the Central and Southeastern United States","223534940":"Probabilistic capacity models and seismic fragility estimates for RC columns","245281617":"Probabilistic Seismic Demand Model for California Highway Bridges","289117812":"Seismic retrofitting of corroded reinforced concrete columns using carbon composites","239347988":"Probabilistic modelling of structural degradation","221396256":"Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization in Engineering Management: An Empirical Study on Bridge Deck Rehabilitation","245211918":"Time-variant reliability profiles for steel girder bridges.” Structural Safety, 30(1), pp. 49-64","239390737":"Reliability of Reinforced Concrete Girders Under Corrosion Attack","227654918":"Methodology for the development of analytical fragility curves for retrofitted bridges","227786378":"Seismic fragility methodology for highway bridges using a component level approach","222516250":"Chloride-induced corrosion on reinforcing steel: From the fundamentals to the monitoring techniques","247256934":"Probabilistic Basis for 2000 SAC Federal Emergency Management Agency Steel Moment Frame Guidelines","257940484":"Structural Reliability Analysis, Prediction","288948070":"Bayesian methods for seismic fragility assessment of lifeline components","223307920":"Multiple design points in first and second-order reliability","245286079":"Nonlinear static procedure for fragility curve development.
