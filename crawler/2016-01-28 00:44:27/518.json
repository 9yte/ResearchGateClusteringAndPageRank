{"abs":"Evolution control in the surrogate-assisted evolutionary and other meta-heuristic optimization algorithms is essential for their success in efficiently achieving the global optimum. In order to further reduce the number of fitness evaluations, a similarity-based evolution control method is introduced into the fitness estimation strategy for particle swarm optimization (FESPSO) [1]. In the proposed method, the fitness of a particle is either estimated or evaluated, depending on its similarity to the particle whose fitness is known. The performance of the proposed algorithm is examined on eight benchmark problems, and the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive on reducing the number of required fitness evaluations using the computationally expensive fitness function.","title":"Similarity-based evolution control for fitness estimation in particle swarm optimization","id":261430380,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261430380_Similarity-based_evolution_control_for_fitness_estimation_in_particle_swarm_optimization","names":["Chaoli Sun","Jian-Chao Zeng","Jengshyang Pan","Yaochu Jin"],"references":{"3904026":"An efficient genetic algorithm with less fitness evaluation by clustering","261046795":"Evolving radial basis function networks via GP for estimating fitness values using surrogate models","220743564":"Classification and regression-based surrogate model-assisted interactive genetic algorithm with individual\u0027s fuzzy fitness","3755900":"A Modified Particle Swarm Optimizer","221787773":"Individual Parameter Selection Strategy for Particle Swarm Optimization","221006438":"A surrogate-assisted memetic co-evolutionary algorithm for expensive constrained optimization problems","228753032":"A fast particle swarm optimization","227065795":"Jin, Y.: A Comprehensive Survey of Fitness Approximation in Evolutionary Computation.
